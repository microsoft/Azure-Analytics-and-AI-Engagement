Security and governance are complex for any organization, and Contoso is no different. Having the right user access is key to achieving business outcomes while driving down vulnerabilities. In this exercise, you will explore **Microsoft Fabric workspace roles** and **SQL native access controls** to effectively manage user permissions to drive down compliance alerts.


In this exercise, you have learned how to manage access control in Microsoft Fabric using Workspace roles and SQL native access controls. You have gained practical experience in:
 
- Understanding the four workspace roles (Admin, Member, Contributor, and Viewer) and their corresponding database permissions.
- Configuring SQL native access controls using the Manage SQL Security UI and Transact-SQL commands.

With this knowledge, you can now effectively manage user permissions and secure SQL Databases within Microsoft Fabric. You are ready to move on to the next exercise [Managing Production Workloads](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/blob/Fabric-SQL-Workshop/Workshop_Exercises/08%20-%20Managing%20Production%20Workloads.md)
