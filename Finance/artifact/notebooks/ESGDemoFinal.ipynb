Through the way we run our business, we seek to create opportunities for our customers and clients, our colleagues, our investors, and for society more broadly. We believe that we can be a real force for good, and that includes a responsibility to be open and transparent about our ambitions and our progress.\nIn this document you will find a report on \nthe environmental, social and governance aspects of our business. This relates to the policies and processes that govern the way our business is run, and to the positive impact we seek to make on our communities and the preservation of our environment.\nClimate change\nOf particular importance, given the climate challenge, you will also find Barclays’ new climate policy. \nWe have been actively reconsidering our \napproach since the autumn of 2019, which led to in-depth discussion at our December Board \nmeeting. Following this renewed focus and \nextensive dialogue with shareholders and other stakeholders, our commitment now is to play much more of a leading role in tackling climate change.\nSpecifically, Barclays’ ambition is to become a \nnet zero bank by 2050, across all of our direct and indirect emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3), and we are committed to align all of our financing activities with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We are one of the very first banks to make such a commitment, across both lending and financing, and across all sectors. We will start with our provision of financing to the energy and power sectors, because energy production and use is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and we will extend this to our entire portfolio over time.\nWe were one of 30 founding banks of the \nPrinciples for Responsible Banking in 2019, an approach that will align Barclays and its peers with society’s goals, as expressed in the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In practical terms, however, the bank is behind where we would like it to be in addressing the climate challenge. This is largely the nature of our business. Fossil fuel financing has, in the developed economies, been largely undertaken by the investment banks. We are the sixth-largest investment bank in the world and the largest of the Europeans. It is therefore not surprising that we are the sixth-largest financier of fossil fuels and the most significant of the European-headquartered banks. It is also true that the bank, with many other priorities over the last few years, including its capital strength and operational resilience, has not addressed the climate challenge as fully and as early as we now all wish had been the case. This is particularly true of our financing for thermal coal, where our historic exposures are higher than we would like, and where we are now introducing new restrictions.\nIn the rest of this letter I would like to \nsummarise the key steps that we will take to address this situation. We are making a serious statement of ambition now, but the full development of the tools by which we will measure our climate impact, and the targets which we will set to demonstrate improvement, will take time; we expect our first updates on targets to be later this year. Throughout, our approach will be positive, \nauthentic and open. We now wish to play a \nleading role rather than being seen to be dragged along and, at the same time, wish to set meaningful targets and disclose openly our activities.\nThere is also, of course, an important risk \ndimension to this. The Prudential Regulatory Authority’s 2019 Supervisory Statement on the financial risks from climate change was an important step in building a more strategic approach across the industry. Alongside other banks, and following the PRA ’s guidance, we continue to refine our approach to measuring and mitigating these risks. This includes the use of scenario analysis and stress testing, over both a short- and long-term time horizon. Barclays is an organisation driven by its Purpose; for our customers and clients, our colleagues, our investors, and for society more broadly.A force for good in societyCHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION\nNigel Higgins\nChairman\nBarclays’ ambition is to \nbecome a net zero bank \nby 2050, and to align all \nof our financing \nactivities with the goals \nof the Paris Agreement.\n\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 03\nAmbition to achieve net zero \nand alignment with Paris\nWhat does achieving net zero mean for \na bank? Barclays already has a plan to be net zero by 2030 in Scope 1 (all direct GHG emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity and heat). This plan is on track. We have halved our operational GHG emissions over the last two years, through the procurement of green energy, and our residual footprint from our properties and business travel is fully offset, which on some definitions would make us net zero today. We are committed to going further: as a member of the RE100 initiative, we are committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity. We are currently at 60%, and are targeting 90% by 2021 and our 100% goal by 2030 at the latest.\nFrom a scope 3 perspective, net zero means \nthat the sum of the business activities that we finance around the world contribute to no net emissions in the world. We will strive to adjust our financing portfolio to mirror the trajectory in energy emissions required to meet net zero, taking the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) as our starting point. Importantly, this will involve supporting our clients in the energy and power fields through the transition period, as well as being prepared to commit more financing to energy innovation.\nWe will also be adopting a strategy, supported \nby specific targets, to engage in financing to the energy and power sectors, and eventually all sectors, in a way that aims to be fully aligned with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. \nThe Paris Agreement seeks to hold the \nincrease in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. These goals imply specific limitations on the amount of carbon that the world can afford to emit in coming years. As a consequence, and with a growing rather than a diminishing demand for energy, not only does the share of renewables in energy sources need to increase dramatically but, in addition, the carbon efficiency of the energy that is produced from non-renewable sources needs to be materially improved.For Barclays, this means that our financing activities ought to be consistent with pathways which will enable the planet to meet the goals of Paris. We will need to develop detailed objectives which combine absolute levels of carbon output together with carbon intensity in order to ensure that we can deliver on our ambition as well as continuing to serve customers and help satisfy the demand for energy in the world. \nIn practice we will seek to:\n■■reduce the carbon emissions arising from \nactivities financed by us; for the energy and power sectors this is likely to be in the region of a 30% reduction in CO\n2 intensity \nin our power portfolio and a 15% reduction in CO\n2 intensity in our energy portfolio by \nthe end of 2025;\n■■prioritise our lending to companies themselves committed to Paris alignment\n■■reduce materially our exposure to the most carbon-intensive forms of energy production;\n■■re-weight our financing, and ultimately other activities too, to reflect the proportion of energy required by the world from different sources in order to meet the Paris target.\nIn respect of both these ambitions, net zero and Paris alignment, I would like to emphasise that we will not be satisfied merely with looking at our loan book, as is the practice of many of our peers. Our activities are wider than this and in particular extend to underwriting and distributing debt and equity securities in our debt and equity capital markets businesses. We intend to align these too to our ambitions, notwithstanding the challenges of measurement which I discuss further below.\nSpecific fossil fuel financing activities\nBarclays has historically been a significant financier of the energy and power industries, although we are a considerably smaller player than our American peers in fossil fuel financing. Nonetheless, we are committed to a material rebalancing of our activities. We will henceforth undertake no financing of drilling in the Arctic. We will provide no financing for fracking in Europe or the UK, and strengthen our due diligence for US fracking.\nWe will commit ourselves to the steady \nreduction in any thermal coal financing so that we will only provide finance to entities whose thermal coal activities represent less than 30% of revenue by 2025 and less than 10% of revenue by 2030. A residual revenue of 10% will enable us to continue supporting clients who are committed to the Paris Goals through their transition where a small, legacy element of their overall portfolio is taking longer to phase out. The emphasis on entities is important as many of our peers set targets at only the group level of their clients, thereby providing greater scope for financing; we look at the actual entity to which we are providing the financing, which is a more restrictive approach. We will not support project finance transactions for the development of greenfield thermal coal mines or to enable the construction or material expansion of coal-fired power stations, anywhere in the world. We will also not provide general corporate financing that is specified as being for new or expanded coal mining or coal-fired power plant development. \nIn respect of the oil sands, this is a very small \nbusiness for us with less than £20m of direct and indirect annual revenue in 2019, even including a provision of finance to ancillary businesses such as pipelines. This is not a business which we have an ambition to grow materially, but nor are we willing simply to walk away from clients. We will only provide financing to clients who have projects to reduce materially their overall emissions intensity, and a plan for the company as a whole to have lower emissions intensity than the level of the median global oil producer by the end of the decade. This approach takes into consideration the just transition for the workforce and communities currently dependent on the oil sands industry in Canada.\n04 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nWe have been in deep discussions with the \ngovernment of Canada about this and believe that this position, which it supports, is the right position to adopt and the best way of enabling our clients which have operations in the oil sands to participate in transition. We are of course aware that this is not as far as some shareholders and other stakeholders would like us to go. However, we need to be mindful also of our commitments to clients and to the wider Canadian economy (we will undertake no oil sands financing at all outside Canada).\nBarclays' commitment to green \nfinancing and to renewables – \npresent and future\nBarclays has been active for some time in \nthe provision of both green and sustainable finance in both its UK bank and in the Corporate and Investment Bank. However, neither the scale of our activities nor our market share reflect where we should be and want to be. We are committed to rectifying this. \nIn the UK retail world, we were the first \nmainstream UK bank to launch a ‘green mortgage’ in 2018. The Barclays Green Home Mortgage offers homebuyers lower interest rates for new-build properties meeting minimum energy efficiency requirements. In 2019, we extended coverage to a further nine major homebuilders (bringing the total to fourteen), who between them build more than half of all new-build residential properties. \nDeveloping a wider range of green products \nis a growing area of focus for Barclays UK, to help our customers transition to the low-carbon economy. During 2019, we conducted consumer research on awareness and attitudes toward green finance amongst our UK customer base. Whilst the research found that a large proportion of consumers currently don’t know how green finance may be applicable to them, there is growing interest. We have established a Sustainability Forum within Barclays UK, to bring together product and channel leads to explore opportunities to support our business and personal banking customers.\nIn 2019, Environmental financing grew by \n45% year on year to a total of £7.8bn. We have seen good growth across our product set in our consumer and wholesale businesses. However, the majority of our current green financing is within the Corporate and Investment Bank. As there is still no industry-wide definition for ‘green’ finance, we are conservative and transparent in our assumptions, and report our share of capital market transactions where we have played an active role, not the total deal value of transactions that may have multiple banks involved. \nIn the Corporate and Investment Bank, we \nsupport the renewable energy and clean technology sector globally, offering strategic advice, and facilitating access to debt, equity and loan financing for wind, solar, geothermal, waste, and hydroelectric power companies. We also continue to enhance our focus on the development of green product structuring capabilities in the capital markets, including green bonds and sustainability-linked financing instruments (e.g. revolving credit facilities). We will build on our leading product range for Corporate Banking clients, including green loans, green trade loans, green innovation loans, green asset finance and project finance.\nWe are continuing to grow our franchise \nin green and sustainable bonds, and other sustainable debt products. Green bond financing has seen further growth in 2019 on the back of another record year for the green bond market. This growth has also seen an increase in the diversity of issuers. We helped lead a wide range of green financings last year, including a €2.0bn green bond for Apple, the largest-ever Euro-denominated green bond issued by a US corporate. Barclays was a joint active bookrunner on Orsted’s £900m Green Bond issuance, which will, in part, help to finance Hornsea 2 - which once complete in 2022 will be able to power over 1.3 million UK homes.\nIn recent years we have also established a \nSustainable and Impact Banking (SIB) team to originate, structure, and execute green, social, and sustainability debt financings. We are expanding this team considerably and it will partner with our energy and power teams, as well as the Corporate Bank, to advise large clients on energy transition.\nWe will also launch the Sustainable Impact \nCapital Initiative within our Principal Investments business. This will target an investment of £175m over a five-year period in the equity of innovative and environmentally-focused private companies. We hope that some of the investments made in this area might contribute to the world’s requirement for technologies which remove carbon from the atmosphere, technologies which are important to the target of net zero discussed above.\nTargets, data and measurements\nOver the coming months, we will develop further the detailed targets which we would like to hit in order to deliver on the ambitions described in this letter and the rest of this document.\nToday, there is something of an arms race \namongst institutes and think tanks to produce metrics to measure the impact of commercial activity on the planet. None of these work perfectly for a bank, in particular not an investment bank. There is a very thoughtful methodology, PACTA, developed by the 2degree Investing Initiative (2°ii) originally to apply to investor portfolios. Barclays is one of the 17 banks involved in the PACTA pilot and has applied that tool across its lending portfolio.\nGiven our commitment to net zero and to \nParis alignment across the totality of our financing activities, we need to develop metrics which can measure lending and other forms of financing including underwriting. We will continue to work with 2°ii but we have also appointed BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory\n1 team to assist us in developing \na broader framework for the activities of a universal bank such as Barclays.\nAt a high level, the methodology we \nare building uses a combination of metrics to assess both the carbon intensity (e.g. kgCO\n2/kWh and kgCO2/GJ) and absolute \ncarbon emissions (e.g. kg/CO2) of different \ntypes of activity. With this approach, we will be able to use metrics most appropriate to different sectors across our portfolio, whilst also ensuring that we can track the overall reduction in absolute emissions over time.\nInitial findings from this work show that \nmoving towards alignment to the goals of the Paris Agreement is likely to require a near-term target of a 30% reduction of CO\n2 \nintensity in our power portfolio and a 15% reduction in CO\n2 intensity in our energy \nportfolio by the end of 2025, on the way to full alignment over time.\nWe will happily share the output of this \nwork both with stakeholders and other banks; indeed, the world would benefit from a standardisation of approach and eventually some kind of certification of data. We aim to make a meaningful contribution to this challenge and intend to provide more detail on the metrics that we will use and the targets that we will set later on this year, probably in November. Full completion of this work across all our sectors may take longer but, in any event, in future we will report our financing activities on the basis of the metrics that we adopt, including sharing whether they are consistent with the glide path to net zero and to Paris alignment.CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION\nA force for good in society\n1 BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) is a distinct and segregated advisory business within BlackRock that is set apart from the firm’s investment activities through \na stringent information barrier.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 05\nDisclosure, TCFD and SASB\nWe believe that comprehensive, robust \nand comparable disclosures are essential to enabling stakeholders to understand our activity and progress. That is true not just in relation to climate change, but also to broader sustainability and ESG matters.\nBarclays was a founding member of the \nFinancial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Since the publication of the Taskforce’s final recommendations, in 2017, Barclays has aligned its disclosures to follow the TCFD guidance.\nWe are significantly increasing both the \nbreadth and depth of our disclosures this year. Our approach now includes scenario analysis and the outcomes of our internal stress test, as well as providing a comprehensive overview of our risk management approach. \nWe have also increased the granularity of \ninformation about our credit exposures in climate-related sectors. For example, we are now disclosing not just our overall carbon-related assets, but also detailed lending data related to climate change risk for a range of carbon-intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and transport. \nMore broadly, we have included additional \ninformation on a wider range of ESG factors this year, to enable a fuller assessment of our activity. Amongst other areas, this includes enhancing accessibility and supporting vulnerable customers, managing responsible conduct across our businesses, and supporting our colleagues. We have reported against the framework established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the first time, which seeks to provide a common framework for material sector-specific issues, and we will continue to enhance this in future years. \nAs a founding member and signatory to the \nPrinciples for Responsible Banking, we will continue to integrate these principles into our business and approach to reporting. Resolutions for our AGM\nThe ambitions described above are encapsulated in a resolution which the Board of the bank is proposing to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. We have had extensive discussions with stakeholders in advance of issuing this and unanimously recommend its adoption by shareholders. We believe that our new approach will set Barclays on a path to becoming one of the leading banks globally in addressing the climate challenge.\nWe have, of course, also engaged in active and \nthoughtful dialogue with ShareAction, who propose an alternative resolution for our AGM. We believe that the extent of our ambition, and the overall strategy that we have set out, actually goes beyond what ShareAction has proposed. We are pleased that ShareAction and many of the co-filers of their resolution are able to support our resolution, in addition to supporting their own. The Board does not support the ShareAction resolution, as we believe it is not practical to implement, gives insufficient emphasis to the concept of transition, and is too narrowly focussed only on the energy and power sectors. We have set out our thinking on the ShareAction resolution in more detail in our Notice of Meeting for the AGM.\nOur wider commitments \nto the community\nAlthough our commitments to tackling \nclimate change are critically important, I would not want them to overshadow the work we are also doing in the community more widely. In this report you will also read more about how Barclays is investing in skills and employability through a range of innovative programmes, as well as supporting our employees to make a difference personally.\nOur LifeSkills programme gives people across \nthe UK the skills, knowledge and confidence they need to get into, progress and succeed in work. The programme has already helped over 10 million people since 2013 and is committed to helping a further 6 million people by 2022.Connect with Work is a multi-national Barclays programme supporting people who face barriers getting into work by providing tailored skills training and connecting them to businesses that are recruiting – including Barclays’ clients and suppliers. The programme supports people who want to get into work but, for a number of reasons, face challenges – such as a lack of experience or confidence, fewer educational qualifications, care requirements or disabilities – and helps them to develop the skills, connections and opportunities that provide a way in, or back into the workforce.\nWe are proud of the support Barclays gives \nto communities by investing money and skills in partnerships with respected non-governmental organisations, charities and social enterprises.\nOur investment amounted to £44.6m in 2019, \nincluding charitable giving, management costs and monetised work hours of Barclays colleagues.\nWe also make a difference through the \nindividual contributions of Barclays people. In 2019, we supported over 9,800 colleagues globally to fundraise for their chosen charities, with a total of £17.8m raised for charities around the world. We also supported 14,600 colleagues to donate through our Payroll Giving programme, which saw us match a total of £1.1m in 2019.\nThe Board and I, as well as the management \nteam, have spent considerable time over the past year looking at Barclays’ purpose. We aspire always to do more, and I hope that the transparency and ambition you see in this report demonstrates a desire to do just that and be a force for good.\n06 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nWe believe firmly that the profession of banking \nhas a unique role in society, and that we can and must do business in a way that does good. The way we do businessCHIEF EXECUTIVE’S INTRODUCTION\nThrough the work we do with our customers and clients we can have a meaningful impact on the progress of our communities and the preservation of our environment, as well as making a positive difference to the health and well-being of our employees. This, for us, is what it means to be an organisation driven by a clear sense of purpose.\nNigel has written in his letter about the specific \nactions we are taking to move more quickly in tackling climate change. The management team is united with the Board in our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, and we are eager to play a leading role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. \nOur responsibilities to society, however, also \nextend more broadly. It is important to us that all of our stakeholders can clearly understand how we manage our business for good, and easily track our progress. This report sets out our approach in respect of not just the environment, but also our social contribution more widely, and the way we govern the organisation.\nA positive social contribution\nWe are particularly proud of the work we have done in 2019 to support local businesses and communities through the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. From our dedicated £14bn SME lending fund, to the daily support of our Relationship Managers, and over 200 ‘Brexit and Beyond’ clinics held across the UK; we were able to provide financial and practical support to help businesses throughout the country to prepare and adapt.\nIt is not just in times of change that we can \nmake a positive difference to society. We believe that banking should work for everyone, and we are committed to making our products and services as accessible as possible. \nWe continue to develop our Basic Bank \nAccount proposition, which gives thousands of people their first foothold in the banking system; last year around 200,000 of these accounts were upgraded to our standard current account. We also offer free Community Accounts for small not-for-profit organisations. And our network of Digital Eagles in the UK continues to help our customers, and the community more broadly, improve their digital skills.We are also helping to keep our customers’ money safe in the face of ever more sophisticated frauds and scams. We stop thousands of these behind the scenes every day, and through our regular communication with customers we’re helping them to know what to look for too.\nRunning a responsible business\nOur code of conduct, which we call The Barclays Way, sets out the standards we expect from everyone who works at Barclays. It’s the basis of our culture, and brings together our purpose and values in a way that clearly defines the behaviours we expect of our people.\nWe believe that our investment in our people \nmakes a critical difference to our culture. We continue to focus on attracting and hiring people with the skills to deliver for our customers and clients, developing them, and creating a working environment that allows them to do their best work.\nWe also, of course, manage the organisation \nthrough significant formal governance, and this report sets out the breadth and depth of our controls. That covers everything from responsible lending and preventing financial crime, to anti-money laundering and anti-bribery, through to data privacy and data security, and much more.\nAs the world around us changes, we constantly \nevolve the formal governance of Barclays to adapt and ensure we remain a well-run organisation. This year, we transferred the oversight of social and environmental matters from the Reputation Risk subcommittee to the full board; reflecting the increasing importance of these topics.\nMaking a difference\nBarclays makes a real difference every day to millions of people and businesses around the world, and to the communities of which we are a part. We know that our success over the long term is based not just on how well we run the organisation commercially, but also on how well we manage it to protect the environment, support positive social progress, and make responsible, well-governed decisions.\nThat is a responsibility we take seriously and, \nas we seek to take a leading role in tackling climate change, we are proud of the contribution we can make.\nJames E.

This includes customers and clients, colleagues, investors and the societies we operate in alike. The longevity of our business can only be ensured if we help tackle the challenges of our time, such as social inequality and climate change, whilst minimising any unintended and adverse impacts of our operations and our business as a financial institution. To this end we seek to identify and understand the environmental, social and governance factors which impact our organisation and conversely how we shape and impact the environment and society around us. This is done in the context of the financial services we provide, the geographies in which we operate and the nature of our customers and clients.Our approach to managing environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is rooted in ensuring the longevity and sustainability of our business.ESG and our businessOUR APPROACH\nGroup income by region\n%\n833554\n2019 \n United Kingdom \n  Europe Americas\n Other\nNote\nPercentages may not cast due to roundings.\nBarclays UK is our UK ring-fenced bank, comprised largely of our UK Personal & Business Banking and Barclaycard Consumer UK businesses.

Every year we review a list of the most relevant ESG topics to ensure they are consistent with the current priorities of our stakeholders. The process is based on a review \nof what is relevant for our sector, the results of direct stakeholder engagement, including surveys and information requests from investors and ESG rating agencies, and an analysis of relevant banking industry frameworks and reporting guidelines.This subjective assessment is based on a qualitative assessment and is not based on any formal financial or legal definitions of materiality. \n Further details are available \nin our Materiality and GRI disclosure at: home.barclays/esg2019\nOne outcome of our 2019 assessment has \nbeen an increase in significance of climate change risk and disclosure as well as social and environmental impacts of financing.

Over the last \ncentury, the burning of fossil fuels has increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere; to a lesser extent but still having a severe impact, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has destroyed natural sinks for CO\n2 and has increased atmospheric \ngreenhouse gas concentrations. \nThe consequences of the changing climate \nsystem are difficult to fully predict, but certain effects are likely, and some act as a catalyst and accelerate others. For example, warmer average temperatures lead to the melting of glaciers and sea ice, but the reducing area of reflective sea ice means the darker sea water absorbs more heat, leading to the increased melting of sea ice. These changes contribute to rising sea levels, but the melting of ice sheets is also thought to contribute to changes in patterns of ocean circulation, which have an important role in regulating regional climates\n2.\nThis last year saw many negative impacts from changing climate patterns, with the rise in extreme weather events such as hurricanes and severe forest fires. These events pose significant risk to individuals, communities, infrastructure (such as homes, buildings, transportation) and economies. Over the longer-term, shifts in climate patterns will have consequences for food security, livelihoods, and human migration, and could lead to significant social, economic and \npolitical upheaval. Many of Barclays’ customers, clients and \ncolleagues will be directly affected and the bank has a role to play in preventing the worst effects from becoming a reality. This will be through supporting climate mitigation activities that will slow and reverse the warming of the planet, but also supporting climate adaptation activities, which make communities more resilient to inevitable physical impacts. \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) has identified the need to limit temperature increases to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels\n3, and make efforts to limit \nincreases to 1.5°C, which would cause lower impacts and risks\n4. We are supportive of the \nfindings of the scientific community, which has set out the changes that society, including the governments, businesses, and civil society, must make to combat climate change. On the most obvious level, this means supporting the transition to a low carbon economy. Connected with this, society needs to assess and reconfigure its use of resources, the efficiency of industrial processes, and the use of land, as well as develop new technologies in energy, transport, and other activities that have hitherto relied on carbon-intensive sources of energy.\nOur approach and ambition \nBarclays can, and should, play a leading role in tackling climate change. The size and scale of our business means that we can make a real difference in helping to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. \nTo be clear: this is a journey. Barclays takes \nseriously the work ahead to build, with multiple stakeholders, the detailed metrics for measuring our progress and targets against which we will report. \nThe Board believes that our new approach will \nset Barclays on a path to becoming one of the leading banks globally in addressing the climate challenge.Becoming net zero\nThe Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol is the world’s most widely used greenhouse gas accounting standard. It provides comprehensive global frameworks to measure and manage greenhouse gas emissions from private and public sector operations, across three broad scopes.\nBarclays already has a plan to be net zero by \n2030 in Scope 1 (all direct GHG emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam). We have halved our operational GHG emissions over the last two years through procurement of green energy, and our residual footprint from our properties and business travel is fully offset, which on some definitions would make us net zero today. We are committed to going further: as a member of the RE100 initiative, we are committed to sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030 at the latest. We are currently at 60%, and are targeting 90% by 2021.\n \nSee pages 38 to 40 for further detail on \nour operational emissions performance and RE100 activity.\nWe are now setting a goal to be net zero in \nScope 3, across all of our financing activity, by 2050. “Scope 3” emissions for a bank are, in simple terms, the GHG footprint of the business activities we finance around the world, across all sectors.\nAligning to the goals of the \nParis Agreement\nThe 2015 Paris Agreement5 is an international \nagreement between parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It has an objective of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. \n1 NASA Earth Observatory earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php\n2  Nasa Science climate.nasa.gov/nasa_science/science/\n3 The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014), available at ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/\n4 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (IPCC, 2018), available at ipcc.ch/sr1 5/\n5 The Paris Agreement background is available at unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreementOur approach to climate changeOUR APPROACH\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 11\nTo achieve the temperature goal, the Paris \nAgreement calls for emissions to peak as soon as possible and then reduce rapidly, to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks (i.e. net-zero emissions) in the second half of this century.\nThis goal is the driver behind governments \nand organisations, including the UK Government, adopting “net zero” as their ambition.\nWe will align all of our financing activities to \nthe goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. We will start with our provision of financing to the energy and power sectors, and we will extend this to our entire portfolio over time. \nA comprehensive strategy, \nwith specific targets and regular \nreporting\nThe pathway to a low-carbon future\nBarclays’ strategy to align with the goals of the \nParis Agreement will take the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) pathway as its starting point. It is already widely used, and thus has an industry dataset that enables us immediately to begin building the tools to align our portfolio. \nThe SDS outlines a major transformation of \nthe global energy system required to make the transition to a low-carbon economy, and meets all of the conditions required for the world to be net zero in the second half of this century. As other approaches and pathways are developed, we will be able to update our planning assumptions to track the best available information.Under the SDS, global CO\n2 emissions fall from \n33Gt in 2018 to less than 10Gt by 2050, and are on track to net zero emissions by 2070.  This scenario has a 50% probability of holding the temperature rise to below 1.65°C, without reliance on global net-negative CO\n2 emissions.  \nIf the technologies necessary to deliver net-negative emissions were to become available at scale, warming could be further limited. We believe that those technologies are likely to be available over the coming decades, but we do not wish to rely on them.  \nWe have therefore set our ambition to be net \nzero by 2050, which gives us confidence that our approach for our own portfolio would remain appropriate even without any future net-negative technologies.\nCompleting the toolset\nBeyond understanding the high-level pathway for alignment, the work required to map the GHG emissions of a bank’s portfolio to the Paris Agreement has made good progress in recent years, but the tools are not yet complete.\nIn September 2019, Barclays joined 16 other \nbanks in piloting the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) – a leading tool developed by the 2˚ Investing Initiative. We continue to be very supportive of the methodology that has been developed, but it is insufficient to fully map the GHG emissions of Barclays’ portfolio. The assessment is narrowly focused on lending, whereas our portfolio requires an assessment of financing more broadly, and its sector-based approach does not yet cover fossil fuels in the level of detail required.\nBecause the tools do not yet exist to map GHG \nemissions from our portfolio in a way which would enable us to deliver on our commitments, we have engaged BlackRock’s Financial Markets Advisory\n1 team to help us \nextend the current best practice in our industry, so that we can map our full portfolio to the Paris Agreement. \nThe work is well underway but will necessarily \ntake some months to complete. We will be able to share more details about our strategy and methodology before the end of this year, in advance of beginning to report our progress from 2021.\nThe methodology Barclays is building uses a \ncombination of metrics to assess both the carbon intensity (e.g. kgCO\n2/kWh and \nkgCO2/GJ) and absolute carbon emissions \n(e.g. kg/CO2) of different types of activity. \nWith this approach, we will be able to use metrics most appropriate to different sectors across our portfolio, whilst also ensuring that we can track the overall reduction in absolute emissions over time. \nInitial findings from this work show that \nalignment to the goals of the Paris Agreement is likely to require a 30% reduction of CO\n2 intensity in our power portfolio and a 15% reduction in CO\n2 intensity in our energy \nportfolio by the end of 2025. We are committed to delivering these reductions by 2025.\nWe plan to release the full detail of the \nmethodology we are building as an open source contribution to the community of practice currently developing tools and methodologies to measure and assess Paris alignment for financial institutions.\nIncreased restrictions in \nsensitive energy sectors\nOur strategy to align with the goals of the \nParis Agreement will cover all of our portfolio in time. But there are some immediate changes we will make to the financing we provide in particularly sensitive energy sub-sectors: \n■■ Increased prohibitions on thermal coal \nWe will prohibit financing to clients with more than 50% of their revenue from thermal coal as of 2020, transitioning to 30% as of 2025, and to 10% as of 2030. A residual revenue of 10% will enable us to continue supporting clients through their transition where a small, legacy element of their overall portfolio is taking longer to phase out. This policy is made significantly more restrictive by being applied at a legal entity level, rather than at a Group level.\n■■No financing for energy projects in the Arctic Circle  \nWe will not finance energy projects in the Arctic Circle; replacing our existing policy of assessing all Arctic development with enhanced due diligence. Nor will we provide funding to ancillary businesses for use in supporting these projects. Furthermore, we will not provide any financing to companies whose primary business is oil and gas exploration and production operations in the Arctic Circle.\n1 BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory (FMA) is a \ndistinct and segregated advisory business within \nBlackRock that is set apart from the firm’s investment \nactivities through a stringent information barrier.In September 2019, \nBarclays joined 16 other \nbanks in piloting the \nParis Agreement Capital \nTransition Assessment \n(PACTA) – a leading tool \ndeveloped by the 2˚ \nInvesting Initiative.\n12 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nto the Paris Agreement and also takes into \nconsideration the just transition for the workforce and communities currently dependent on the oil sands industry in Canada. This new policy is an example of the role that Barclays can play in transition, more constructive in its impact than simply abandoning Canadian oil sands. \n■■No financing for EU/UK fracking, and strengthened due diligence for fracking in the rest of the world  \nWe will not finance projects involving fracking in Europe, including the UK. We will assess all projects involving fracking outside of Europe with enhanced due diligence.See pages 53 to 55 for further detail on \nour increased energy sector restrictions.\nThese near-term actions alone will not be \nsufficient to enable us to deliver our strategy for alignment to the Paris goals, but we believe they demonstrate our commitment to making a meaningful difference.■■Helping to reduce the environmental footprint of oil sands  \nWe will only provide financing to clients who have projects to reduce materially their overall emissions intensity and a plan for the company as a whole to have lower emissions intensity than the level of the median global oil producer by the end of the decade. We will expect our clients to, within a reasonable period, develop plans to achieve these reductions by 2030. Whilst our oil sands financing business is very small (revenue of around £20m per annum), our relationship with Canada is important. Our new approach is the result of active engagement with the Canadian government, which is itself also a signatory Our approach to climate changeOUR APPROACH\nWe are focused on all 3 scopes in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\nWe will do this by setting, disclosing and implementing a strategy with targets; starting with, but not limited to, the energy \nand power sectors.\nWe will report annually on progress under that strategy, starting from 2021.Become a net zero bank by 2050 on Scopes 1, 2 and 3Our ambition \nWe will reduce the carbon footprint of our energy portfolio by aligning our financing of the power and energy sectors to the Paris \nAgreement, using an industry-leading tool, with clear targets. Aim to achieve a 30% reduction of CO2 intensity in our power portfolio and \na 15% reduction in CO2 intensity in our energy portfolio by the end of 2025.\nWe are expanding our recently set up Sustainable and Impact Banking (SIB) coverage group and other teams across corporate and investment banking to engage with clients on our green financing capabilities. \nWe will launch the Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative (£175m) within Principal Investments, which will be invested over a 5-year period \nin the equity of innovative, environmentally focused private companies.Our commitment to align our entire portfolio of financial services to the Paris Agreement,  \nstarting with, but not limited to, the power and energy sectors\nIncreasing green financing to £100bn by 20301Paris alignment Green financingIncreased prohibitions on thermal coal, including no financing for companies with revenue from thermal coal mining or power of >10% by 2030.Increasing restrictions in sensitive energy sectors to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon futureIncreased energy sector restrictions No financing for EU/UK fracking and strengthened due diligence for fracking in the rest of the world.Help to reduce the environmental footprint of oil sands.

We expect \nthe proportion of green financing in our portfolio to increase significantly over time as we support the shift to a low-carbon economy. \nWe are further accelerating the transition by \nlaunching a Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative, to invest £175m over a 5-year period in the equity of innovative, environmentally-focused private companies. We are also targeting the commercial opportunities we see being created as a result of the greater focus on sustainability. \nSee pages 22 to 28 and pages 45 to 48 \nfor further information on green financing products and services.Risk management\nThere is also of course an important risk \ndimension to this. The Prudential Regulatory Authority’s 2019 Supervisory Statement on the financial risks from climate change was an important step in building a more strategic approach across the industry. Alongside other banks, and following the PRA ’s guidance, we continue to refine our approach to measuring and mitigating these risks. This includes the use of scenario analysis and stress testing, over both a short- and long-term time horizon.\nSee pages 41 to 65 for further \ninformation on climate-related risk management within our TCFD disclosures.Principles for Responsible Banking\nThe Principles for Responsible Banking \n(PRB) provide a single framework for the global banking industry to embed \nsustainability at strategic, portfolio \nand transactional levels, and across all business areas.

We are \ncommitted, through our governance model, to driving four key features: simplification, collaboration, accountability and quality of decision-making.GOVERNANCE\nOur Group-wide governance framework has been designed to facilitate the effective management of the Group by our CEO and his Executive Committee (ExCo) whilst preserving the constructive challenge, support and oversight of our major subsidiary boards in the UK, Ireland and the US, consistent with their respective legal and regulatory responsibilities. The Barclays PLC (BPLC) Board sets the strategic direction and risk appetite of the Group and is the ultimate decision-making body for matters of Group-wide strategic, financial, regulatory or reputational significance.\nBPLC is the Group parent company and has a \npremium listing on the London Stock Exchange. Each of our main operating entities, Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC), Barclays Bank UK PLC (BBUKPLC), Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays US LLC and Barclays Bank Delaware, has its own Board comprising Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Each also has its own board committees.During the year, we consolidated and streamlined membership of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards, such that membership of the BBPLC Board is now a subset of the BPLC Board, with all members of the BPLC Board except the Senior Independent Director (SID), the Chairman of BBUKPLC and one Non-Executive Director now also serving on the Board of BBPLC. This partial consolidation has significantly increased coordination and efficiency, and reduced complexity and duplication. The revised BBPLC Board composition vests oversight over the activities of BBPLC in a board the members of which also have direct accountability to BPLC’s shareholders through their separate responsibilities as members of the BPLC Board.Recognising the importance of our culture, reputation, the environment and social and human rights matters to all our stakeholders, the Barclays PLC Board took over responsibility for these matters from the former Board Reputation Committee during 2019. This decision ensures that the Board has direct responsibility for the oversight of the most important matters.\nPlease see the Director’s Report within the \nBarclays PLC 2019 Annual report for further detail on corporate governance and Board sub-committees. \n \nAdditional information including our \nframework, code and rules are available at: home.barclays/who-we-are/our-governance\n Our governance framework\nBoard governance framework\nRisk Committee\n• Monitors and recommends \nthe Group’s financial, operational and legal risk appetite\n•  Monitors the Group’s \nfinancial, operational and legal risk profile\n•  Considers reports on key \nfinancial and legal risk issues\n•  Oversees conduct and \ncomplianceNominations Committee\n• Reviews the composition of the Board\n• Recommends the appointment of new Directors\n• Considers succession plans for key Board and ExCo positions\n• Oversees the annual Board effectiveness review Audit Committee\n• Assesses the integrity of the Group’s financial reporting\n• Evaluates effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls\n•  Scrutinises activities and \nperformance of internal and external auditors\n•  Reviews and monitors the \nGroup’s whistleblowing policiesBarclays PLC\nResponsible for the overall leadership of the Group\nRemuneration \nCommittee\n• Sets overarching principles \nand parameters of remuneration across the Group\n• Considers and approves remuneration for the Chairman, Executive Directors, other senior executives and certain Group employees\n• Oversees remuneration issues\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 19\nPurpose, culture and values\nOur Purpose, adopted in May 2018, is \n‘Creating opportunities to rise’. This is underpinned by our Values: Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence and Stewardship, and by the behaviours associated with them. Our Purpose, Values and behaviours are designed to support each other, to drive our culture and to guide our strategy and decision-making.\nThe Board has recently examined our Purpose \nand concluded that whilst it is fully integrated into many of our key processes and decision-making forums, we have further work to do to bring it to life, to express and apply it consistently across the Group, and for it to better connect all of our stakeholders, our businesses, ESG activities and ambitions. This work is under way. \nOur Values were adopted in January 2013. \nThey were, and remain, fully embedded and integrated into the Group. Our culture is a core area of focus for the Board, which believes that the right culture and values, supported by effective leadership and a consistent tone from the top, are crucial to the success of the Group.\nHow does the Board review \nour culture?\nThe Board reviews our culture in a number \nof ways, including:\n■■quantitative and qualitative feedback on how our culture aligns with our Purpose, Values and strategy through Culture Dashboards, so the Board can see the effect our people engagement has on our performance, and the continued strength of our culture;\n■■analysis of employee survey results;\n■■face-to-face engagement with employees locally to hear what they think;\n■■review of people policies, which are designed to provide equal opportunities and create an inclusive culture, in line with our Values and in support of our long-term success.Board  \nresponsibilities\nSetting strategy\nand\npromoting our  \nculture and purposeengaging with our \nstakeholders\nandwithin a framework \nthat aligns our values \nwith our strategyentrepreneurial and \nethical leadership\nand byand\neffective internal and \nfinancial controlwhilst\nsetting risk  \nappetite and risk \nmanagementchallenging and \nsupporting management \nto drive sustainable \nvalue creation for our \nshareholders\nthroughand \ncompliance with law and \nregulation\n20 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nEnvironmental and Social Impact \nCommittee Chair: Group CEOGroup Risk  \nCommittee\nTCFD ForumSustainability \nForumsBarclays PLC Board\nGroup Executive Committee\nBoard deep dives in 2019 \nThe Board’s agenda in 2019 has been \nsignificantly influenced by a comprehensive ‘listening tour’, undertaken by our new Chairman following his arrival at Barclays in March, before he became Chairman in May. Nigel Higgins held around 50 meetings with shareholders and other stakeholders as part of this ‘listening tour’ and has also subsequently spent considerable time this year meeting with stakeholders across the globe as part of his induction, including with our investors, customers and colleagues.\nThe Board and Executive Committee used the \nfeedback to agree a prioritised series of deep dives which now form a significant part of each Board meeting. These deep dives have helped to facilitate an in-depth understanding of issues, with a view to helping management and the Board make well-informed decisions both now and in the future. The deep dives conducted in 2019 covered a wide range of topics, including focus on particular business areas, capital allocation, our culture, our societal purpose and environmental matters.\n \nAdditional information including our \nframework, code and rules area available at: home.barclays/who-we-are/our-governance/\nBoard Risk Committee focus \non climate\nIn 2019, the Board Risk Committee reviewed \nthe significant enhancements the Group has made in its approach to the management of the risks of climate change. Both physical and transition risks, across all portfolios, were considered in the context of a severe but plausible climate stress. This analysis will support the Group’s response to the forthcoming Bank of England industry-wide stress test. This progress was welcomed whilst acknowledging the need for risk management practices generally to evolve further across the whole industry in respect of climate change risk. \nManagement oversight\nWe continue to strengthen the integration of social and environmental issues into our business. The Barclays PLC Board assumed responsibility for these matters from the former Board Reputation Committee during 2019. This decision ensures that the Board has direct responsibility for the oversight of the most important matters in this area.\nDemonstrating the growing strategic \nimportance of these issues, the Group Executive Committee created the Environment & Social Impact (ESI) Committee in June 2019 to manage the overall delivery of our environmental and social strategy and underlying initiatives. \nChaired by our CEO, the ESI is convened to \nprovide senior oversight and set the overall direction of Barclays’ strategy to manage its broader social and environmental impacts.\nIn addition, following the Bank of England’s \nSupervisory Statement on enhancing the banks’ approach to managing the financial risks from climate change in April 2019 (SS3/19), we appointed the Group Chief Risk Officer as Senior Manager responsible for climate-related financial risk under the Senior Managers Regime.

The team is focused on identifying and supporting new, high-growth clients, that are solving environmental or social challenges, with advice and financing needed to accelerate their growth and scale their impact. It will also serve and advise existing clients on their sustainable growth strategy and financing needs. \nOur existing platform for green and \nsustainable finance also continues to grow as we work towards facilitating £150bn in social and environmental financing by 2025. \nAs part of our climate change approach set \nout on pages 10 to 13, we will also increase our commitment to green finance, with a new target to provide at least £100bn of Green Finance by 2030\n1.2019 performance\nIn 2019 we facilitated £34.8bnr (2018 \n£28.5bn) of social and environmental financing, a year on year increase of 22%. To date we have facilitated £63.3bn against our target of £150bn. This is made up of social and green financing based on use of proceeds, as governed by Barclays’ Impact Eligibility Framework, as well as financing provided through the use of sustainability-linked loans. While the use of proceeds of sustainability-linked loans is not restricted to activities under the framework, they link the pricing mechanism to the achievement of sustainability-linked targets consistent with the approach set out in the LMA Sustainability Linked Loan Principles and therefore provide a means of integrating sustainability considerations in existing lending products. \nWe have seen strong growth in social and \ngreen segments and given the increased significance of sustainability-linked products have integrated them into our 2019 performance reporting. We have updated the 2018 comparative to include sustainability-linked loans as set out in the second graph on the right. \nSocial and environmental financing methodology \nOur financing volume is tracked and screened using Barclays’ Impact Eligibility Framework, which provides clear social and environmental inclusion criteria to track and categorise financing volumes, which includes both labelled green and social transactions and a wider use of proceeds analysis against eligible social and environmental themes. \nThe framework was developed in collaboration with Sustainalytics, a global provider of ESG \nand corporate governance research, ratings and analytics.\nWe are conservative and transparent in our assumptions, and report our share of capital \nmarket transactions where we have played an active role, not the total deal value of transactions that may have multiple banks involved.\nIn addition, the data marked with the \nr symbol is subject to limited assurance by KPMG.With a key focus on the impact of our financing, \nwe are continuing to grow our product offering and social and environmental financing activity across the bank.Social and environmental financingMAKING GROWTH 'GREEN', SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE\nSocial and environmental financing\n£bn\n£34.8r\n20182019\n£28.5£34.8\n£31.7 2017\nSocial and environmental financing\n£bn\n20182019\n1.4\nN/A21.8 5.3\n26.9 4.83.1 23.9 7.8\n2017\n Green\n Social\n Sustainability-linked\nNote\n2018 social and environmental financing has been \nrestated from £27.3bn to £28.5bn to include \nsustainability-linked loans.\nSocial and environmental financing \nby region\n%\n2019 1.8 14.4\n18.5\n Americas\n UK and Europe\n Rest of World\nFurther information, including our \nESG Reporting Framework and definitions can be found at: home.barclays/esg2019Details of our wider financing activities including a sector breakdown are found in the TCFD section starting on page 41.\nr 2019 data subject to limited assurance by KPMG.

Following a sector-wide decrease last year, related to changes in the US tax code, US municipal financing rebounded in 2019 as state and local governments moved aggressively to lock in low financing costs using both tax-exempt and taxable debt structures. Barclays’ notable transactions included large financings for several US states and large cities, as well as municipal utilities and housing agencies.\nBarclays led an innovative US$50m social \nbond issue for HealthRIGHT 360, a non-profit organisation providing healthcare to the most vulnerable and under-served communities in California. The transaction marks the first time Barclays has led a social bond for a US client, and the first-ever social bond for a non-profit issued in the US municipal bond market.\nGreen and Sustainable \nCapital Markets \nIn March 2019, our Banking business \nformalised and launched the Green and Sustainable Capital Markets team. \nThe team originates, structures and executes \ngreen, social and sustainability debt capital market transactions as well as new products and issuance frameworks for our clients globally.\nWorking in collaboration with coverage, sector \nand product teams, the team works to identify tailor-made debt solutions for clients as they continue on their individual journeys to transition to a sustainable low carbon economy.\nIn 2019, the team executed a wide range of \ngreen, social and sustainability transactions, such as a joint active bookrunner on Orsted’s £900m of Green Bonds issuance, which will, in part, help to finance Hornsea 2 - which once complete in 2022 will be able to power over 1.3 million UK homes. See page 47 for further information on green finance. Corporate lending\nIn the Corporate Bank we have seen year on year growth in public sector finance, green loans and green infrastructure finance. \nIn 2019, Barclays acted as a mandated lead \narranger and hedge provider on the financing of Neart na Gaoithe, a 448MW offshore wind project located off the east coast of Scotland. After construction, this major project, owned jointly by EDF and ESB, will cover an area of 100km\n2.\nWe have also seen a rapidly growing interest and uptake in sustainability linked loans, which integrate sustainability performance factors and targets into general purpose lending facilities. Most commonly, GHG emission reduction targets have been factored into pricing mechanisms but we continue to explore a wider set of environmental and social metrics with our clients where they are relevant to their businesses. \nRetail banking\nIn 2019 we also enhanced our green and sustainable retail product offering. \nWe have been working to improve accessibility \nof existing green finance products for example through the reduction of lending thresholds for our UK Green loans from £1m to £25k. The Sustainable and \nImpact Banking group\nThe Sustainable and Impact Banking \n(SIB) group is advising two groups of corporate clients; emerging growth \ncompanies with an innovative \ntechnology or business model that is enabling the low-carbon economy; and large established companies that \nare transitioning their businesses to \nbecome more sustainable. The SIB group advises these companies on corporate strategy and capital raising.\nWith respect to the emerging growth \ncompanies, the SIB group is initially focused on companies in four key sectors: Food and Agriculture, Clean \nEnergy Technologies, Recycling and \nthe Circular Economy and Water. Each sector contains a growing pipeline of companies that are helping to address \nclimate change and lower carbon \nemissions. In addition to the positive environmental impact, the companies exhibit strong financial potential.\nIn 2019, Barclays acted as financial \nadvisor and placement agent to Califia \nFarms, a leading independently owned plant-based food and beverage company, on a US$225 million private \ncapital raising. Califia’s plant-based \nmilk beverages produce 60-80 percent fewer greenhouse gasses than consuming cow’s milk. The offering was one of the largest private \ncapital raisings within the natural \nfoods sector and allows Califia to further invest in increased production capacity, substantial R&D, deeper US \npenetration, and continued global \nexpansion. \nAlso in 2019, Barclays acted as \nlead left Bookrunner on TerraForm Power’s US$700m of 4.75% Senior \nUnsecured Notes due in 2030. \nTerraForm Power owns and operates a best-in-class renewable power portfolio of solar and wind assets in \nNorth America and Western Europe. \nTerraForm Power is the owner and operator of a 4,070 MW diversified portfolio of high-quality solar and wind assets underpinned by long-\nterm contracts.\n24 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nIllustrative SDG breakdown of our social and \nenvironmental financing\nBarclays recognises the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as \na set of shared global priorities to be achieved by 2030. The 2030 Agenda was adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 and is based on a set of 17 interconnected Goals, with 169 defined indicators. These relate to positive human, societal and environmental factors, and are to be reached through committed engagement and multilateral collaboration.\nWe acknowledge the importance of business, along with \ngovernments, society and other stakeholders to work together to make the 2030 Agenda a reality. Barclays is committed to play its part as an institution which connects people and capital, and work in partnership with our stakeholders to support the delivery of the Goals. \nOur social and environmental financing covers supranational and \nregional development agencies, as well as businesses from all sectors and generates positive social and environmental contributions through financing of healthcare systems, universities, social housing authorities, and green infrastructure projects.Financing of these activities in turn supports progress on the SDGs. Based on an analysis of the sectors, institutions and projects supported through our social and environmental financing and a mapping to the indicators underlying the SDGs we have identified the goals most significant supported which are illustrated in the graphic below.\nOne large component of our social and environmental financing is \nto supranational, regional and national development institutions whose missions are consistent with the sustainable development goals. However, while some of these provide breakdowns of their financing activities, across institutions this data is not sufficiently enriched to enable an attribution to individual SDGs. As a result, we have grouped supranational, regional and national financing in their own category (highlighted in grey below). Based on the information available, key SDGs supported through our supranational, regional and national financing include:\n■■SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities;\n■■SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth;\n■■SDG 13 Climate Action; and \n■■SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy.\nAs better information becomes available, we will refine our methodologies in order to provide more granular insights.\nIllustrative SDG breakdown of 2019 social and environmental financing\n%\n17.51 5.56 48.91 7.96 3.99 6.05 8.20\n0.290.50 0.83\n  Good health and well-being\n Quality education\n  Affordable and clean energy  Industry, innovation \nand infrastructure\n  Sustainable cities and communities  Supranational, regional and national\n  Zero hunger\n  Gender equality   Clean water  \nand sanitation\n  Decent work and economic growth\nBeyond our financing activities \nour community programmes and partnerships contribute to Goal 8  \n(see pages 89 to 93).Social and environmental financingMAKING GROWTH 'GREEN', SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 25\nClient engagement\nWe have held over 4,500 meetings in the \nCorporate Bank alone to engage with clients on the Green agenda, which is supported by our framework for Regulatory, Reputational, and Commercial drivers. This is a 50% increase on 2018, and underlines the increased importance of ESG issues for our clients and our increased focus on responding to this need. \nFor further details on our approach \nto green finance see page 41.■■Systematic: The Barclays Quantitative \nPortfolio Strategy group within Research focuses on developing evidence-based empirical analysis of the market relationships between ESG ratings of issuers and the performance and valuation of their debt and equity securities.\nThe three pillars of Barclays ESG Research will feed into and inform each other to produce new and actionable ESG insights that enable investors and asset owners to assess the impact of regulatory and consumer change on markets and industries; the extent of adoption of ESG principles by companies under coverage; and how and to what extent adoption of ESG is influencing portfolio performance.Sustainable & Thematic Investing\nAs investors increasingly look to align investments with Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations, the Investment Bank Research team aims to help clients navigate this new paradigm.

Recognising the impact that every investment has, Barclays has continued to integrate these considerations into our investment processes and services for our clients. \nResponsible investing\nForemost, across all of our investment management areas, including Barclays Investment Services Limited (BISL) and Barclays Asset Management Limited (BAML) in Barclays UK and the Private Bank in Barclays International, we endeavour to operate as responsible investors. This means we are committed to seeking to deliver the best possible risk-adjusted returns for our clients and believe that responsible investment, including environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations should be integrated into our own investment processes.\nBy being cognisant of these ESG factors, we \nbelieve investors will be better equipped to make informed decisions about the financial performance and longer term viability of an investment. Therefore, we seek to incorporate any foreseeable risks and opportunities that arise from material ESG factors across all our investment offerings. Externally, BAML serves as our signatory to the UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and has achieved an ‘A ’ score for investment modules in our last annual submission. We also support the aims of other ownership commitments, such as the UK Stewardship Code, to be active and engage on behalf of our clients.Sustainable investing products \nand services \nIn addition, we offer a variety of investment \noptions for clients who want to express their ethical views, to make social or environmental focused investments, or to intentionally seek to generate a specific societal outcome alongside their financial returns. \nFor example, in the Private Bank we offer our \nSustainable Discretionary strategies combining ethical screens (including exclusion of investments in the fossil fuel industry), ESG integration, and positive selection for companies supporting the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. \nAdditionally, our Barclays Multi-Impact \nGrowth Fund within BAML blends selected specialist impact fund managers across a range of asset classes and impact areas within a single investment offering available for retail clients. This year, the fund published its first annual impact report to provide visibility and transparency on both the investment and impact performance of the underlying managers. \nMarket building efforts\nIn the rapidly evolving field of sustainable and impact investing, Barclays has become a globally recognised player\n with deep expertise \nacknowledged by the industry and government. We have continued to participate in industry initiatives such as The Impact Management Project – a global effort coordinated by Bridges Impact+ team of over 2,000 organisations to establish a common language for impact investing. Additionally, we have seen social businesses account for a large and growing portion of the UK business sector. Their business models lie on a spectrum ranging from strongly commercial to purely charitable, with many combining these elements to respond to complex and challenging community, environmental and broader societal concerns. However, they are not usually seen as high growth or opportunities for investment capital. Therefore, in order to better understand the challenges and dispel the myths surrounding these important businesses, we partnered with the ScaleUp Institute to produce a research report entitled: Social Scaleups: High growth businesses with impact. \nFinally, we have continued to work to inform \nand support our clients to identify sustainable investment opportunities and risks for their portfolios. This has included publishing client briefings on topics such as ageing populations or renewable energy. We also hosted client sessions in all our global locations on incorporating climate change considerations in line with TCFD guidance.\n Barclays’ Responsible investing \npolicy: barclays.co.uk/wealth-\nmanagement/important-information/responsible-investing-policy  \n Barclays’ Multi-Impact Growth Fund Impact Report: barclays.co.uk/\ncontent/dam/documents/wealth-management/investments/multi-impact-growth-fund-annual-report-2018.pdf  \n Social Scale-Up Report: scaleupinstitute.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Social-Scaleups.pdf\n Barclays’ public PRI Reports are \navailable at: unpri.org\nWe are committed \nto seeking to deliver \nthe best possible \nrisk-adjusted returns for \nour clients and believe \nresponsible investment \nsupports this aim.Social and environmental financingMAKING GROWTH 'GREEN', SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 27\nGreen bond portfolio\nWe remain wholly committed to the green \nbond market, both as an investor and as an issuer. \nAs an investor, we have continued to expand \nour Green Bond portfolio across 25 investment grade issuers.

This is particularly true in the United Kingdom, where we have been part of the fabric of the country for over 325 years. \nAs our home market experienced uncertainty \naround Brexit through the year, we continued to support local businesses and communities through this period of change.\nFrom farmers embracing the fourth industrial \nrevolution, to manufacturers forging trade links in new markets, small, medium and large businesses across the UK continued to demonstrate ambition, innovation and resilience. \nTo help them fulfil their potential we \nlaunched our dedicated support package for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) – the lifeblood of the economy. This included a dedicated £14bn SME lending fund, our extensive network of on-the-ground Relationship Managers checking in with local businesses and over 200 Brexit and Beyond clinics, held across the UK.\nEach clinic brought local businesses together \nto hear about one another’s experiences, and equipped them with practical support on a range of issues, including cash flow, trade and exports, labour access and supply chain management. When local businesses could not come to us, we went to them. In a single week, our #FrontFoot initiative saw 2,200 of our banking experts walk the UK’s high streets and industrial estates, to check-in with over 30,000 businesses on Brexit preparedness.We also know that fast access to finance is a priority for many small business owners. That’s why in a High Street banking first, we launched pre-assessed unsecured lending of up to £100k on our mobile app and online banking platform, with funds typically deposited within 24 hours.\nOur network of Eagle Labs continued to grow \nand support even more local entrepreneurs throughout the UK (see page 32). Our Unreasonable Impact programme has supported 27 fast growing, social and environmental focused companies in the UK.\nBarclays' £1bn Housing Delivery Fund, \ncreated in partnership with Homes England, is helping to boost the UK’s housing stock, with £360m of funding directed to projects aiming to build at least 80,000 homes by 2030.\nWe also continued to support social housing \nproviders to access funding, including Longhurst Group, one of the largest providers of affordable housing across 50 local authorities in the Midlands and the East of England. \nHelping local economies \nto thrive\nTaunton Deane in the South West of England \njoined Bury and Kilmarnock on our Thriving Local Economies initiative. \nDuring each three-year programme, we are \nworking closely with local councils, schools and business groups to better understand what help and support they need to thrive, and how Barclays can play its part to make it happen. \nOur support for local economies also extends \nto helping people to access the skills and employment they need to succeed, where they live. \nWhilst LifeSkills continues to equip millions \nof people with the skills they need in a changing economy, Connect with Work has helped to support 1,075 people into work in the UK with 630 businesses across the country in 2019 (see page 92).\nWe are proud to back nearly one million \nbusinesses who put their trust in us every day, and we are committed to playing our full part in ensuring that the whole country continues to thrive – our future depends on it. \nFind out more at: home.barclays/\nbackingtheukSME fund\n£14bn\nSupporting UK businesses\n 1m\nBrexit clinics\n200+\nWhen the customers, \nclients and \ncommunities we serve \nsucceed, Barclays \nsucceeds.  \nThis is particularly true in the United Kingdom, \nwhere we have been part of the fabric of \nthe country for over \n325 years.

There were 577,365 Barclays Basic Accounts open at the end of 2019, as we upgraded over 200,000 Basic Current Accounts to standard Barclays Bank Current Accounts. Our Basic Current Accounts are available to anyone who does not already have a bank account or who is not eligible for a standard account and includes over the counter services, access to ATMs and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances.\nAccess to a transactional bank account \nenables consumers to benefit from bill reductions paid by direct debit and access to cheaper goods and services on the internet, which goes some way towards alleviating the poverty premium.\nCommunity account\nWe also provide free banking to over 130,000 small not-for-profit organisations through our Community Accounts, including sports and community clubs, religious groups, and local charities.\nProduct research and design\nWe make customers central to our proposition development processes and use market research, insight, data analytics and data science to ensure their needs are at the core of our design principles. \nWe use behavioural science principles to \ndevelop a deep understanding of customer/ human behaviour and how people make decisions. We apply behavioural science thinking to proposition, service and communication design. We also train teams throughout the organisation to use Behavioural Science principles to support our customers when they are making decisions.We use “test and learn” approaches and analysis to quantify how our customers react to product changes, and to assess how fair they feel the value exchange that we provide is. Our analysis assesses the changes that customers make to their product holdings, their account balances, and how frequently they use our services.\nWe apply suitable risk criteria, for example \nwhen offering unsecured loans, and use analytics to offer personalised pricing at an individual level. \nMeeting customer needs \nIn our journey to creating life-long relationships with our customers, we centre our approach around understanding the motives and goals they are hoping to achieve. We are moving away from the traditional banking way of thinking, focused around their financial product needs, to develop a more customer centric mind-set that is rooted in a customer’s underlying need. We achieve this by:\n■■Segmenting our customers across a lifetime from youth, to young adult, family and retirement to be able to tailor offerings that are relevant to them as their needs evolve over time. \n■■Identifying the key ‘jobs’ where many customers share certain goals and experience similar challenges in achieving them, which we can support them in making progress.\nWe maintain robust and iterative research and design processes to ensure customer needs are consistently being met as we develop new products and services. We start from a point of discovering what customers are trying to achieve at key life moments, to ensure that our products are very relevant to customers in their specific life stage. Our product development toolkit contains a series of check-ins and tests to ensure that potential new products still meet a core customer need. \nOur Customer Voice sessions bring customers \nclose to our senior leaders so they can hear first-hand about customers’ lives, aspirations and struggles. This keeps our customers front of mind for our leadership teams.We believe that banking should work for everyone.Accessible retail  \nproducts and services\nNumber of Basic current accounts*\n20182019\n725,000577,365\n674,000 2017\n* 200,000 accounts upgraded to standard \ncurrent accounts in 2019.\nFraud prevented\n£720m\nOur NPS®1 customer experience research \nprogramme provides an understanding of \ncustomers’ relationship with Barclays and their experience of a multitude of touchpoints with us.

Also through qualitative research we have explored financial capability and triggers of vulnerability, both systemic and dynamic. This informs our proposition and service design, to help us identify issues early on, to help prevent financial vulnerability.\nUsing data, we have developed a financial \nvulnerability model to assess customers’ current state of financial resilience. This model can be used to tailor contact and content to the most relevant products and resources for the customer’s situation. \nBarclays mortgages  \nand first-time buyers\nWe continue to help our customers on their \nhome-buying journey with a 9% growth in gross lending year-on-year.\nIn 2019, we helped over 29,000 first-time \nbuyers onto the home-ownership ladder and \nsignificantly more homeowners to make their \nnext move. In 2019, we helped over 128,000 customers take out a mortgage or further borrowing on their property, 23% of whom were first-time buyers.\nOur Family Springboard Mortgage allows \nhomebuyers to secure a mortgage with the help from family or friends (helper), while allowing the helper to earn interest at the same time. \nTo improve the affordability and access to our \nFamily Springboard Mortgage in the UK in 2019, we increased the maximum available term of the loan up to 35 years. Additionally, we increased the term of the helper savings deposit – the period during which the helper’s funds are committed and during which the helper earns interest – from three to five years. Fraud and scams\nTo help keep our customers safe, we’ve invested millions of pounds in multi-layered security systems that protect against frauds and scams. We prevent thousands of attempted fraudulent transactions every day, and stopped over £720 million of fraud from taking place in the past year alone.\nDigital accessibility \nWe continue to improve our customer experience for all our customers as well as those who have specific accessibility requirements. Our main digital channels including mobile banking apps and websites have been or are being accredited for accessibility by AbilityNet, a leading UK accessibility charity. \nCheque Imaging which allows customers to \nlodge cheques using their mobile phone is now available and we are the first bank to allow customers to connect other bank accounts into our accessible mobile banking app, following the introduction of Open Banking. Video banking is now helping hard of hearing customers reliant on lip-reading to connect with us.\nOur network of Digital Eagles is helping our \ncustomers, as well as the wider community, to develop and improve necessary digital skills. In 2019, this network was expanded to include universities and public sector organisations across the country. Our Tea and Teach events which previously targeted retirees now also provide basic online safety training and know-how to parents and teachers with 113,000 people attending our face to face events.\nThese activities are complemented by \nBarclays’ Digital Wings, our free online learning platform for digital education. Branch closures\nOur customers are increasingly choosing to access our products and services digitally, and as a result are using our branches less and less. That means we must constantly assess how and why our branches are used, and make commercial decisions based on that information. \nWhere we take the difficult decision to close \na branch, we work closely with the local community to understand their needs and any alternative solutions we can provide. These solutions will be specific to each area but may include cashback from local retailers, arrangements with the nearest Post Office, or pop-up branches, as well as Barclays collect for businesses, video banking, fully automated facilities or cash machines. We also work closely with customers in communities across the UK to help them access and feel confident in using our digital services through our team of Barclays Digital Eagles. \nIn October 2019, we made a commitment to \nfreeze branch closures for ‘last-in-town’ and remote locations, protecting 105 branches for at least two years, and we will maintain a full service proposition for our customers through the Post Office for the next three years.Accessible retail  \nproducts and servicesMAKING GROWTH 'GREEN', SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE\n1  Net Promoter, Net Promoter System, Net Promoter Score, NPS® and the NPS® related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems, Inc.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 31\nWe recognise the potential of sustainable innovation \nas a driver for improved productivity and economic growth and actively support it within Barclays as well as in the markets in which we operate.Sustainable innovation\nFor Barclays, sustainable innovation encompasses multiple mechanisms for fostering growth, including developing new commercial financial products and services which address environmental and social needs, exploring novel ways to support local businesses and encouraging the growth of FinTechs (financial technology) and disruptive technologies for the financial services sector.\nSocial Innovation Facility\nThe Barclays Social Innovation Facility (SIF) is an internal mechanism that incubates ideas for financial products and services that seek to specifically address environmental or social challenges, and continues to be one of Barclays’ most innovative mechanisms to advance socially and environmentally impactful products and services in a commercial way.Rise\nKnown as the #HomeofFinTech, Rise is a global community of the world’s top innovators working together with Barclays colleagues, partners and clients to create the future of financial services. Members of the programme across the world get access to a diverse programme of training, workshops and events, as well as opportunities to connect into our Barclays network of colleagues, clients, partners, investors and industry experts. At the end of 2019, we had over 175 technology companies resident at Rise, and a virtual community of over 1,000 members.\nRise is also home to our Barclays Accelerator, \npowered by Techstars, an intensive 13-week programme designed to fast-track the next generation of FinTech businesses, while also bringing innovation and application opportunities to Barclays. The programme has 170 alumni companies with a portfolio valuation of over $1bn and in January 2019 Barclays launched ‘Rise Growth Investments,’ providing investment capital of up to £10m per Barclays Accelerator. To date Barclays has taken an equity interest in 70 of these, reinforcing Barclays’ commitment to FinTech innovation and enabling us to invest in strategically-relevant companies and bringing growth to both the start-ups and the bank.\nMore information on Rise is available \nat: rise.barclays/\nBarclays Social Innovation Facility\nVentures supported since 2015\n28\nProducts launched since 2015\n8\nProduct case study\nSIF is supporting a proposition in the \nMunicipals Public Finance group that provides banking services to \nCommunity Choice Aggregators \n(CCAs). CCAs are innovative municipality-owned programmes in the US that allow local governments to procure power on behalf of their \nresidents, businesses, and municipal \naccounts from an alternative renewable supplier while still receiving transmission and distribution services \nfrom their existing utility provider. CCAs \nare an attractive option for communities that want more local control over their electricity sources and more green power being offered, but because they \nare relatively new entities, traditional \nbanking products are not fit for purpose.\nAn example of this is our relationship \nwith San José City Council, which \nagreed in April 2019 to expand San José \nClean Energy (SJCE)’s revolving credit agreement with Barclays from $50 million to $80 million. The \nincreased credit facility will allow SJCE to \nmake additional purchases of clean power into future years, thereby further hedging future electricity costs and maximising customer savings.Colleague engagement \ncase study\nSIF plays its part in supporting \ncolleagues to realise their full professional potential.

This includes the client transaction review process, which is managed by a dedicated Environmental Risk Management team, as part of the central Credit Risk Management function, as well as the Group Sustainability and Reputation risk teams. Our approach to environmental and social risk management is based on a combination of statements, standards and guidance. The position statements are developed in consultation with external stakeholders and aligned with industry best practices, such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards. \nWe have developed internal standards within \nthe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and these are a core part of transaction origination, review and approval processes, where applicable. This enables us to adopt a robust approach, while maintaining the flexibility to consider potential clients and transactions on their respective merits.MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS\nDefence Sector Ramsar Wetlands/\nWorld Heritage SitesForestry & Palm Oil Energy &  \nClimate ChangeExternal position statements in place during 2019\nInternal standards to embed provisions\nClient Assessment \nStandard\nNuclear Industry Risk \nStandardEnvironmental Risk \nStandardEnterprise Risk Management Framework\nIntegrated into risk management process and 3 lines of defence model\nGuidance notes for business and sanctioning teams on 10 sensitive sectors and associated environmental and social impactsForestry & Palm Oil  \nFeb 2019Energy &  \nClimate Change  \nJan 2019Ramsar Wetlands & \nWorld Heritage Sites \nApr 2018Defence Sector \n2002Environmental Risk \nin Lending \n2016\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 35\nRisk identification\nBarclays’ front office business teams are \nresponsible for identifying transactions and relationships that may present significant environmental and social risks. These may include broader considerations on human rights, labour practices and operations in sensitive geographies. These teams also review client relationships and transactions that are in scope of our position statements and internal standards, as part of their due diligence.\nOur property and land valuers can use our \nenvironmental screening product, Barclays SiteGuard, to assess the history of a piece of land and the operational implications of a site’s current or intended commercial use. Where appropriate, cases are referred to the Barclays’ Environmental Risk Management team for review. In 2019, 3,880 commercial properties were screened using a Barclays Siteguard Report, with 1531 cases referred.\nCredit risk teams also identify higher risk \ntransactions and are able to leverage their regional, sector and product-related expertise to identify environmental and social risks. \nThe Group Sustainability and Environmental \nRisk Management teams provide training to both front office, credit risk and compliance teams to raise awareness of the risks in particular sectors and understand their responsibilities in identifying these risks. In 2019, training was provided to 600 colleagues. We also have developed detailed industry-specific risk guidance notes covering more than 50 environmentally and socially sensitive activities across 10 different sectors to further support business line and function teams. Sectors covered include, for example, Agriculture and Fisheries, Oil and Gas, Mining and Metals, and Utilities and Waste Management.\nEnhanced due diligence\nWhere significant environmental and social risks are identified, or the client or transaction is in scope of our statements and standards, this will be referred to the Group Sustainability team and Environmental Risk Management team to advise on enhanced due diligence. This may include a review of the client’s policies, performance and practices, as well as their commitments and capacity to manage the identified risks. We may also review independent third party reports and assessments, and engage with the client directly to better understand how these risks are managed.Escalation and decision \nWhere relationships or transactions are considered to be high risk following the enhanced due diligence review, these are then escalated to the appropriate regional and business unit Transaction Review Committee, which contains senior business and control function representatives. Where necessary, this may be escalated to a Group-wide forum such as a sub-committee of the Group Executive Committee or ultimately to the Board for final decision. \nDecisions will be informed by the extent to \nwhich we can work with the company to mitigate the risks causing concern. In cases where clients are unable or unwilling to agree to an action plan to address identified risks, or the risks are deemed too high, we may decline to support the transaction or continue the client relationship. \nMonitoring \nWe believe that we can have a greater positive impact through supporting clients to improve their performance within a reasonable time frame, rather than declining all transactions that carry heightened environmental or social risks. To achieve this, we may, as part of the escalation and decision process, require that environmental and social management requirements are integrated into loan documentation, and work with the client to develop a time-bound action plan to address significant risks. In these instances, we will monitor the client’s progress on a regular basis.\nDuring 2019, 523 transactions were reviewed \nfor social and environmental risks; four of those transactions fell within the scope of the Equator Principles.Transactions subjected to social and \nenvironmental risk review in 2019 by sector\n2019 transactions by sector\n94\n107\n1652\n8\n1423\n13416\n22\n37  Agribusiness/\nfood production/\nforestry\n Chemicals\n  Defence, aerospace \n& security\n  Infrastructure and transportation\n  Manufacturing and engineering\n Metals and mining\n Oil and gas\n  Power/Renewable power (biomass, \nhydro (dams),  \nhydro (run of river), solar, tidal and wind)\n  Business and Financial Services\n Waste\n Other\nNote\nThere is a disproportionately high number of \ndefence-related transactions due to internal, \nmandatory escalation rules.\n36 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nEquator Principles\nFor project related finance, we apply our \nEnvironmental Risk Standard which implements the Equator Principles and relevant IFC Performance Standards.

The Statement contains a number of requirements for clients with forestry, pulp and paper or palm oil operations that address deforestation risks and promote sustainable land use practices. For example, we require that clients establish a public commitment to prohibit the conversion of tropical forests, peatlands and high conservation value areas, and also require that clients achieve certification of their operations based on a credible certification scheme such as Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) or Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). \nWe also produced a progress report on our \nimplementation of the Banking Environment Initiative’s Soft Commodities Compact, which we adopted in 2015. The report details the steps we have taken to support clients in the soft commodities supply chain to achieve zero net deforestation, and provides an assessment of the certification coverage of our clients involved in the production of palm oil, timber products, and soy.\n Our progress report on the Banking \nEnvironment Initiative’s Soft Commodities Compact can be found at: home.barclays/esg2019Human rights and \nmodern slavery \nAt Barclays, we operate in accordance with \nthe International Bill of Human Rights, and take account of other internationally accepted human rights standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We respect and promote human rights through our employment policies and practices, through our supply chain screening and engagement and through the responsible provision of our products and services. This year we worked to embed human rights considerations into our client due diligence processes in sectors with elevated human rights risks. For example, we included forced labour considerations in our Forestry & Palm Oil Statement and indigenous rights/ local community engagement in our Energy & Climate Change Statement.\nModern slavery is a priority human rights \nissue for Barclays, and we are committed to combating this across our business, client and customer relationships, and our supply chain. In 2019 we refreshed our assessment of supply chain modern slavery risks and developed a detailed modern slavery due diligence questionnaire that was piloted with a range of higher risk suppliers in order to better evaluate the risks in our supply chain.\nBarclays also participated in the Finance \nAgainst Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) Initiative led by the United Nations, which seeks to improve access to financial services for survivors of modern slavery and human trafficking. Barclays developed a procedure for opening bank accounts for survivors – who may not have access to required identification and verification documents – and successfully opened its first survivor bank account in October. \nBarclays full position statements can be found on the Barclays ESG hub \nat home.barclays/esg2019\n• Climate Change\n• Code of Conduct\n• Data Protection\n• Defence Sector\n• Donations\n• Environmental Risk in Lending\n• Financial Crime\n• Forestry and Palm Oil\n• Governance and Financial Crime \nstatements • Health, Safety and Welfare\n• Human Rights\n• Modern Slavery\n• Resilience\n• Supplier Code of Conduct\n• Supply Chain\n• Tax\n• The Barclays Way\n• World Heritage Sites and Ramsar WetlandsMANAGING OUR SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\nEnvironmental and social \nimpact management\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 37\nThird-party operational and \nreputational risk management\nBarclays will always require that our suppliers \ncomply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards within the geographies in which they operate. \nSupplier relationships are assessed and \nmanaged based on the inherent risk posed to Barclays through provision of the services, and suppliers assessed as non low-risk are required to sign up to and adhere to Barclays Supplier Control Obligations (SCOs) covering operational risks and the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) that covers reputational risks. The SCOs and SCoC are published on the Barclays website for all new and existing suppliers to view and are refreshed on an annual basis or more frequently if required to meet Barclays current standards and the latest regulatory requirements.\nBarclays’ SCOs and SCoC can be found \nat: home.barclays/who-we-are/our-suppliers/our-requirements-of-external-suppliers\nThe Barclays SCOs set forth expectations \nof suppliers considered medium and high risk across several risk categories including Compliance, Data Privacy, End-User Developed Applications, Health and Safety, Information and Cyber Security, Payments Processing, People Screening, Physical Security, Records Management, Resilience and Technology risk.\nThe Barclays SCoC, informed by the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines, an international set of voluntary codes, sets forth our minimum expectations with regard to Environmental Management, Human Rights, Diversity and Inclusion, Societal Responsibility, Product Responsibility, Whistleblowing and working in accordance with the Barclays Values. In instances where standards outlined in the Supplier Code of Conduct differ from local laws and customs, we expect suppliers to respect these standards within the context of the customs and the local laws of their specific geography.\nSuppliers’ adherence to the SCO and SCoC is \ncaptured pre-contractually via a Pre-contract \nSupplier Assurance Attestation (Pre-SAA). Any control gaps/weaknesses are captured in the Sourcing Risk Log which is submitted to the subject matter expert who will opine on the appropriate course of action, based on the level of risk associated with the control gap(s). Some of the gaps will be remediated before contract, some will be conditions of the contract and others will be accepted within the Barclays risk appetite and approved by the subject matter expert.Post-contractually, on an annual basis, Barclays seeks ongoing assurance from the supplier that SCO controls continue to be designed and operating effectively. The assurance approach used is agreed based on the inherent risk associated with the supplier/service(s) provided and may take the form of on-site testing, remote desktop testing or a supplier attestation, or any combination of these approaches. Any control gaps or weaknesses identified are reviewed with the Barclays Executive accountable for the relationship and subject matter experts and remediation actions agreed, monitored and tracked to completion. Additionally, on an annual basis, suppliers categorised as non low risk must attest to their ongoing commitment to meet the expectations placed upon them within the SCoC and, where they are unable to meet these expectations, remediation must be progressed in order for the relationship with the supplier to remain in good standing.\nPrompt payment\nPrompt payment is critical to the cash flow of every business, and especially to smaller businesses within the supply chain as cash flow issues are a major contributor to business failure.\nBarclays PLC is a signatory to the Prompt \nPayment Code in the UK. We commit to paying our suppliers within clearly defined terms, and to ensuring there is a proper process for dealing with any issues that may arise. We measure prompt payment by calculating the percentage of third-party supplier spend paid within 45 days following invoice date, or receipt date if the invoice is received late (45 days from invoice date and where purchase order was raised ahead). The measurement applies against all invoices by value over a three-month rolling period for all entities where invoices are managed centrally.\nWe achieved 85% (2018: 82.1%) on-time \npayment by value to our suppliers, meeting our public commitment to the suppliers of 85%. This metric was affected by a change in procurement systems last year. Barclays started its three year journey to implement a new procurement system in 2018. This new system is a leading digital purchasing and invoice processing solution, designed to improve the buying experience for Barclays and bring benefits to our suppliers with increased transparency. \nThe Duty To Report on Payment Practices and \nPerformance Legislation requires reporting on a six-month rolling average, by volume, where we measure percentage of payments made in line with contractual payment terms. Under this definition we paid 79% and 83% of UK invoices on time in H1 and H2 2019 respectively.In 2020, we plan to carry out a strategic review of our approach to managing human rights risks, partnering with an external expert organisation. We anticipate that the results of this exercise will help inform improvements to our customer and client due diligence processes in particular and updates to our policy framework.\nFurther information on the Finance \nAgainst Slavery and Trafficking (FAST) Initiative can be found at: fastinitiative.org/\nSupply chain\nBarclays supply chain overview\nWith nearly 14,000 companies from more \nthan 26 countries supplying us, our supply chain helps our businesses deliver for all our customers, clients and colleagues.\nBarclays Execution Services, the central \ntechnology and functions business, is responsible for more than 50% of global third-party spend and supporting both (1) \nBarclays International – whose products and \nservices are designed for our larger corporate, wholesale and international banking clients and (2) Barclays UK – whose products and services are designed for retail and consumer customers and small to medium sized enterprises based in the UK.\nThough our businesses are geographically \ndiverse, nearly 90% of our third-party spend is concentrated in the UK and US, our two home markets.\nOur supply base is diverse across scale and \nownership type and structure, including start-ups, small and medium-sized businesses, businesses owned, controlled and operated by under-represented segments of local societies as well as multinational corporations. In 2019, we achieved 8% of global spend with small and medium sized enterprises and businesses owned by women, ethnic minorities and other under-represented entrepreneurs.\nThose we contract directly with, also known \nas first-tier suppliers, generally fall into one or more of the following categories: Corporate Real Estate & related services, Technology Infrastructure, Software & Services, Banking Operations, Professional Services, Marketing and Human Resources. \nMany of our suppliers have their own \nextensive supply chains, connecting us to thousands more businesses and employees worldwide.

This is part of our wider strategy around reducing our overall footprint, which prioritises reducing operational carbon emissions through improved energy efficiency and sourcing low-carbon energy where it is cost effective to do so. We further drive carbon management and reduction downstream through working with suppliers and partners to instil a low carbon culture. Lastly, we offset unavoidable emissions from energy use in buildings and in business travel.

Since the publication of the taskforce’s final recommendations, in 2017, Barclays has aligned its disclosures to follow the TCFD guidance. \nThis is Barclay’s third year of reporting with \nreference to the TCFD. We have significantly increased our disclosures across each of the four overall TCFD categories as well as the 11 underlying recommendations, including specific guidance for banks. \nBuilding on our scenario analysis work in 2018, \nwe are disclosing our Group-wide exploratory stress test on climate which has increased our knowledge and understanding of forward looking impact assessments. We have also increased the granularity of information about our credit exposures in climate-related sectors. For example, we are now disclosing not just our overall carbon-related assets, but also detailed lending data related to climate change risk for a range of carbon-intensive sectors, such as steel, chemicals and transport.\nWe will continue to enhance our disclosures in \nfuture years and will work to reflect emerging guidance on TCFD from regulators and other bodies. Barclays will also continue to play an active role in national and global fora on TCFD and associated climate disclosure matters. We believe that comprehensive, robust and comparable disclosures are essential to enabling stakeholders to understand our activity and progress. CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nTCFD recommendations\nThe TCFD recommendations\nThe purpose of the TCFD was to develop climate related financial disclosures that could be widely adopted and would provide decision-useful information to investors, lenders, and insurance underwriters about the material risks posed by climate change. The TCFD focused on four core elements that are applicable to organisations across sectors and jurisdictions. The core elements of Governance, Strategy, Risk management and Metrics and targets are underpinned by eleven recommended disclosures that help banks and others understand how the reporting organisations assess climate-related risks and opportunities.\nGovernance\nStrategy\nRisk  \nmanagement\nMetrics  \nand targetsGovernance\nThe organisation’s governance  around climate-related risks and opportunities.\nStrategy\nThe actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and  \nopportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy, and financial  \nplanning.\nRisk management\nThe processes used by the  organisation to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks.\nMetrics and targets\nThe metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.Barclays support for TCFD\nFounding  \nmember  \nof TCFD2016/2017\nSigned \nStatement  \nof SupportJun 2017\nBarclays  \n1st TCFD \ndisclosureFeb 2018\nBarclays  \n2nd TCFD \ndisclosureFeb 2019\nBarclays 3rd, \nenhanced TCFD \ndisclosureApr 20201 of 16 Banks \ninvolved in UNEP \nFI TCFD Pilot \nPhase 12017/2018\nParticipating  \nin Phase 2 of \nUNEP FI TCFD \nworking group2019/2020\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 43\nOverview of progress against recommendations\nTCFD Focus Area Recommended Disclosure Our Disclosure\nGovernance\nDisclose the organisations governance \naround climate-related risks and opportunities.Describe the board’s oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n■■Oversight on climate change, including reputation risk, at Board level\n■■Environmental and Social Impact Committee (sub committee of Group ExCo) sets overall direction on Climate Change strategy.\n■■Oversight of financial and operational risks from climate change at Board Risk Committee.Describe management’s role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. \nStrategy\nDisclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation’s businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.

The forum reports into ESI on Barclays’ response to the issue of climate change, including; the approach to climate-related opportunities and risks within the bank; and ensuring public commitments on the TCFD recommendation are upheld. Divisional sustainability coordination\nThe 2019 launch of the ESI has inspired the creation of multiple Sustainability Forums focused within specific business areas including Investment Banking, Corporate Banking and Retail and Business Banking. These forums advance and replace the work of the Barclays Green Banking Council, which was started in 2017. They operate in a targeted manner to drive client, employee and stakeholder engagement on environmental and climate change issues, whilst continuing to develop a leading product set to support our clients’ transition to a low-carbon economy.Group governance of \nclimate matters\nThe Barclays PLC (BPLC) Board sets the \nstrategic direction and risk appetite of the Group and is the ultimate decision-making body for matters of Group-wide strategic, financial, regulatory or reputational significance. More detail about the Group’s overall governance framework can be found on pages 17 to 20.\nA key development during 2019 has been that \noversight of social and environmental matters, including climate change, has been taken up by the Board, where previously it was overseen by the Board Reputation Committee. This change in governance confirms the importance placed on these topics. Areas considered by the board in 2019 included our strategy on green financing, our policy positions relating to carbon intensive industries and our commitments to aligning with the goals of the Paris Accord.\nIn addition we appointed the Group Chief Risk \nOfficer as Senior Manager responsible for climate-related financial risk under the Senior Managers Regime. \nFor further information on governance \nof climate risk please refer to page 50.\nEnvironmental and Social \nImpact Committee\nDemonstrating the growing strategic \nimportance of these issues, the Group Executive Committee created the Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) Committee in June 2019 to provide senior oversight and set the overall direction of Barclays’ strategy to manage its broader social and environmental impacts. Chaired by the Group Chief Executive, with representation from business and function leadership, the Committee provides strategic management oversight, sets a firm-wide approach on key-topics and monitors execution against priorities.

The resilience this brings means we can deliver value to all our stakeholders.\nOur diversification is a real strength, and we will \nmaintain and increase our diversity as we evolve. Our revenue today comes from different businesses, different types of customer and client, different types of income, and different geographies. We believe this diversification creates the balance and resilience required to deliver through the economic cycle. As a result of having such a broad range of products and services, we can support our customers and clients across almost all of their financial needs. It also creates opportunities for growth. Across our businesses there are multiple areas where we benefit from significant scale – and where there is opportunity to further enhance the products and services we deliver for our customers and clients, without materially increasing capital deployed. \nStrategic diversification is also relevant from a \nclimate change perspective. Total carbon related assets in the energy and utility sectors are around 4% of our total loans as at December 2019 (see pages 62 to 63 for further detail). In terms of our broader capital markets financing and underwriting, the overall capital raised for energy, utility and mining clients, is around 12.7% of the total capital raised across all sectors.\nSee pages 10 to 13 for information on \nBarclays’ ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050.Impact of climate-related risks \nand opportunities on strategy\nIn reference to the TCFD guidance, we provide a \ndetailed view of the opportunities we see in supporting the transition to a lower carbon economy and growing our Green Finance activity. Information on our risk management approach and the emerging use of scenario analysis and stress testing tools to assess the resilience of our strategy can be found on pages 50 to 61. \nSupporting clients and customers\nWe aim to support our clients and customers in achieving sustainable and inclusive growth that is aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement, via the provision of products and services to facilitate transition and adaptation. \nWe do not think that simple divestment achieves \nthe aim of transitioning the economy. Instead, we recognise that engaging clients and mobilising the capital required for them to transition their own business models is the way to steward the most progress, both in terms of financing more ‘green’ activities and business models, and in transitioning the polluting elements of their business activities. We will prioritise and support those clients that are making progress in their own Paris-aligned transition journeys. \nSupporting the transition \nto green finance\nEstimates suggest that between $320 and \n$480 billion of additional investment will be needed each year up to 2030, to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, in addition to reallocating existing investment in energy systems to renewable and green sources\n1. \nWe are committed to supporting our clients in making the significant financial investments required to mitigate and adapt to climate change, whether financing their investment in efficiency, new forms of low-carbon technology, resilience in their business operations, or helping new markets to evolve and flourish through renewable and other low-carbon technologies. \nIn order to achieve the ambitions of the Paris \nAgreement, state and private-sector actors will need to work together to develop low carbon energy systems; low carbon approaches in building & construction, transport, manufacturing and other sectors; smarter cities (incorporating technology to improve urban planning and energy efficiency), a shift towards more sustainable agriculture, smarter resource management, and decarbonisation. Our aim is to actively support those efforts through the development of specialised products, services and expertise, and we take seriously our responsibility to engage clients proactively on these and other environmental and social issues. \nAt the same time, we are mindful of the complex \nchallenges faced by countries seeking to strike a balance between achieving sustainable economic development and industrialisation, while trying to mitigate climate change and adapt to its consequences – what is termed a “just transition”. We are committed to supporting this transition by identifying and financing the deployment of affordable, sustainable and economically feasible technologies that provide energy security over the long term, which is crucial for both developed and developing economies. We also recognise that where we decide to actively support a client that is transitioning its technology base or operating model – and by virtue of that transition its employee base – as a financial service provider, we take responsibility for asking our clients the right questions about their response to the displacement of individuals from the security of employment; particularly those from more vulnerable groups.\nMany government and corporate clients will \nneed to train and upskill their current and future workforce on the importance of this transition. There will be an important role for financial institutions to play in terms of providing finance for this activity and this is something we will explore with our client base accordingly.\nHow we organise our coverage of clients \nto support transition and green growth\nAs part of our ambition to continue to support \nclients’ transition activities, to develop innovative new financing products, and to embed support for green and sustainable products and services across our operating model – we have established dedicated client-facing teams to advance this work.\nSupporting corporate and \ninvestment banking clients\nBarclays supports the renewable energy and \nclean technology sector, offering strategic advice, and facilitating access to finance for renewables including wind and solar, energy storage solutions and other innovations that will support the transition.\nWe also continue to enhance our focus on the \ndevelopment of green product structuring \ncapabilities in the capital markets and corporate banking markets including green bonds and sustainability-linked financing instruments (e.g. revolving credit facilities). \n1 International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis assessment (IIASA) “Energy investment needs for fulfilling the Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development \nGoals,” pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/1 5328/ \n46 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nSupporting entrepreneurs \nand growth ventures\nWe also recognise that the solutions to the \nworld’s social and environmental challenges, including climate change, will come from a range of actors, which includes innovative and creative entrepreneurs, and agile start-up or early stage companies. \nBarclays has developed a range of activities \nthat commits to supporting entrepreneurs and early-stage businesses with ambitions to have a positive social and environmental impact, particularly those that are scaling rapidly. \n■■We are further accelerating the transition by launching a Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative, to invest £175m over a 5-year period in the equity of innovative, environmentally-focused private companies. This will be managed by Barclays Principal Investments team. Underpinning the initiative is the strategic aim to help support Barclays’ long-term goal of transitioning its businesses, customers and communities to a more sustainable operating model. emerging growth companies, the SIB group is initially focused on companies in four key sectors: Food and Agriculture, Clean Energy Technologies, Recycling and the Circular Economy and Water. Each sector contains a growing pipeline of companies that are helping to address climate change and lower carbon emissions. In addition to the positive environmental impact, the companies exhibit strong financial potential.\n■■In 2020, the newly formed Corporate Bank Sustainable Product group will focus initially on how it can grow the market in renewables, project finance and sustainability-linked loans, whilst working with traditional product teams to develop future ESG offerings for SME and some large corporate clients. The team will also continue to develop and promote our suite of green products for Corporate Banking clients (see diagram on page 25). \n■■The Green and Sustainable Capital Markets team will continue to support our growing franchise in green, social and sustainability debt products (bonds and loans). ESG debt financing has seen further growth in 2019 with a broader range of issuers accessing such debt products as they continue on their individual sustainability journeys.We will build on our leading product range for Corporate Banking clients, including green \nloans, green trade loans, green innovation loans, green asset finance and project finance capabilities to support clients that may not be able to access the capital markets.\nEnvironmental financing grew by 45% year on \nyear to a total of £7.8bn (2018: £5.3bn). We have seen good growth across our product set in our consumer and wholesale businesses. Alongside our strategy to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, we will increase our commitment to green and sustainable finance, with a new target to provide at least £100bn of Green Finance by 2030\n1.\nWe expect the proportion of green financing in our portfolio to increase significantly over time as we support the shift to a low-carbon economy.\n■■The Sustainable and Impact Banking (SIB) group within the Investment Bank is advising two groups of corporate clients; emerging growth companies with an innovative technology or business model that is enabling the low-carbon economy and large established companies that are transitioning their businesses to become more sustainable. The SIB group advises these companies on corporate strategy and capital raising. With respect to the \n1 Target time frame 2018-2030. Eligible categories and basis of calculation in line with Barclays Impact Eligibility Framework, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, low-carbon transport, \nsustainable food, agriculture and forestry.\n2 Unreasonable Impact is available at unreasonableimpact.comCompany sizeFinancing requirements Growth stage companies Mid-size corporates Large corporates and governments Supporting clients across the spectrum \nGreen and Sustainable Capital Markets\nOrigination, structuring and execution of Green, Social and Sustainability Debt products for \nour global clients including governments, public sector, corporates and financial institutions\nSustainable and Impact Banking Group\nStrategic advisory, capital raises for growth companies and collaboration across the firm to support  \nESG integration for corporate and investor clients \nSustainable Product Group \nCorporate Bank focus on renewables, green products and \nsustainability-loans Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative\n£175m principal equity investments \nUnreasonable Impact\nInternational network of accelerators to support businesses \nsolving social and environmental challengesStrategyCLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 47\n■■In 2016, we created Unreasonable Impact2, \na multi-year partnership with \nUnreasonable Group, to launch the world’s first international network of accelerators focused on scaling up entrepreneurial businesses that will help employ thousands of people around the world, while solving critical environmental and societal challenges. Through the programme, Barclays is committed to supporting over 250 high-impact businesses by 2022.\n■■The Barclays Social Innovation Facility (SIF) is an internal mechanism that incubates ideas for profitable financial products and services that seek to specifically address environmental or social challenges. SIF has contributed to the development of a number of products in the climate finance and sustainable capital market spaces, such as the Barclays Multi-Impact Growth Fund and the Social and Impact Banking Group.\nClient engagement\nWe have held over 4,500 meetings in the Corporate Bank alone to engage with clients on the Green agenda, which is supported by our framework for Regulatory, Reputational, and Commercial drivers. This represents over a 50% increase on 2018, and underlines the increased importance of ESG issues for our clients and our increased focus to respond to this need.\nProducts and services to \nfacilitate the transition\nAs social and environmental challenges are \ntackled globally, our clients increasingly need advisory and financing solutions that can help them to achieve commercialisation and scale. Institutional and other investors are increasingly interested in environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, policies and practices. \nIn recent years, as we have reorganised and formed new business teams and grown knowledge and expertise in these areas, we have increasingly supported clients with these solutions – but we also recognise our need to continue to grow this capability. With the help of the aforementioned sustainability forums around the bank, these efforts are well under way.The dedicated client and product level teams, working together with the wider traditional sector and product expert teams across the bank, will support our clients in three broad areas:\n1. Climate change mitigation investment \n– decarbonising operating models, from \nsupply chain through to production;\n2. Climate change adaptation investment \n– responding to physical risks presented by \nclimate change-related extreme weather, including resource scarcity; and \n3. Strategic diversification and pivoting \nbusiness models – advising clients on \ntransactions and strategies to reposition their business and maintain competitiveness.Offering solutions for consumers \nIn 2019 we also enhanced our green and sustainable retail product offering. Our Barclays Green Home Mortgage offers homebuyers lower interest rates for new build properties meeting minimum energy efficiency requirements. In January 2019, we extended its distribution to a further nine major homebuilders (bringing the total to fourteen), who between them build more than half of all new-build residential properties thereby further increasing the availability of green finance solutions.Helping clients issue Green Bonds and financing renewable \nOrsted Green Bond\nBarclays helped Orsted, a leading global renewable energy company headquartered in Copenhagen, to issue £900m green bonds to fund its offshore wind projects. Since 2006, the company has reduced their emissions by 86% and committed to become carbon neutral by 2025. To become 100% carbon-neutral, the company will continue to drive out the remaining emissions from its energy generation and operations by investing in innovation and offsetting any residual emissions through certified carbon removal projects. The proceeds raised will in part help to finance Hornsea 2, which once complete in 2022 will be able to power over 1.3 million UK homes and take the title as the world’s biggest offshore wind farm.\nApple Green Bond \nIn November 2019, we priced a €2.0bn green bond for Apple. The transaction was the largest ever Euro-denominated green bond issued by a US corporate, and the second-largest Euro-denominated corporate green bond offering of all time. Apple intends to use the proceeds from the offering to finance one or more of its ‘Eligible Green Projects’: mitigating its impact on climate change by reducing the carbon footprint of its supply chain, pioneering the use of greener materials in its products and processes, and conserving resources by transitioning to recycled and renewable materials for production. Renewable Project Bond series in \nJapan\nBarclays has helped Renewable Japan Co. Ltd \nissue a series of green project bonds during 2019, with a total issuance of JPY 44 billion (308 million GBP) through six bonds. Barclays acted as sole green structuring advisor and sole bookrunner on these transactions, with strong demand from Japanese life insurers, against continuous demand in ESG investment.\nRenewable Japan is a leading general service \nprovider in the renewable energy sector in Japan, specialising in development and operation of solar power plants. The Group also manages a publicly listed infrastructure fund, Renewable Japan Energy Infrastructure Fund, while the total capacity of the mega-solar plants that the Group has developed and operated to date reaches 500MW, estimated at US$1.8bn as pipeline asset value in Japan.\nFinancing offshore wind farms\nIn 2019, Barclays acted as a mandated lead arranger and hedge provider on the financing of Neart na Gaoithe, a 448MW offshore wind project located off the east coast of Scotland. After construction, this major project, owned jointly by EDF and ESB, will cover an area of 100km\n2.\n48 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nDeveloping a wider range of green products is \na growing area of focus for Barclays UK to help our customers transition to the low carbon economy. During 2019, we conducted consumer research on awareness and attitudes toward green finance amongst our UK customer base. Whilst the research found that a large proportion of consumers currently don’t know how green finance may be applicable to them, there is growing interest. We have established a Sustainability Forum within Barclays UK, to bring together product and channel leads to explore opportunities to support our business and personal banking customers.\nAcross our Private Banking and Wealth & \nInvestments businesses, Barclays has a growing number of clients who are seeking both to protect and grow their assets, and to make a positive contribution to our world. Recognising the risks, and opportunities, of climate change is an integral consideration in how this business invests for clients. For those who want a more active stance, climate-focused investment products and services are provided, including fossil-free or lower carbon \nstrategies. These range from discretionary \nportfolios, a selection of third-party funds, private asset funds, or direct investments into companies addressing climate issues. The Private Bank regularly publishes briefings to inform clients about specific risks and opportunities their investments will face, including those posed by climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. \nAdvocacy and public policy engagement\nGovernment action is central to making the shift to a low carbon economy. Governments have the ability to commit to a strong position, create an appropriately ambitious policy environment, and drive consistency across sectors. In 2015, Barclays committed to the Paris Pledge for Action, and we support the 195 governments, and more than 300 cities around the world which are working towards their commitments under the Paris Agreement. We seek to work closely with governments in the geographies in which we operate to support the development of practical and ambitious policies where appropriate. We support the creation of national green finance strategies, such as the UK Green Finance Strategy launched in 2019, which specifically aim to support the mobilisation of finance towards the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nWe also participate in relevant global \nconversations about what productive public policy could look like on the issue of climate change, both bilaterally with relevant Government departments and via sustainable finance focused industry working groups, such as the UK Green Finance Institute, UK Finance, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) and the Institute of International Finance (IIF). On a senior level, we chair the UK Government’s Global Resource Initiative and are members of the UK Finance Sustainable Finance Committee and the CBI Energy and Climate Change Board. \nIndustry and multi-stakeholder \nengagement\nWe seek multi-stakeholder and industry \npartnership opportunities related to climate change. Barclays is a member of, or signatory to, a number of climate-specific initiatives. We have been a member of the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) for more than 20 years. We were proud to partner with UNEP FI, and to collaborate with other members to develop the Principles for Responsible Banking, launched in September 2019. \nAs we deepen our understanding of future \nclimate-related risks and opportunities, we have continued to engage with peers, industry experts and academics to assess transition to a zero-carbon economy and consider emerging methodologies for aligning bank portfolios to the Paris goals.\nIn 2019, we joined 17 international banks as a \npilot group working with 2 Degrees Investing Initiative (2°ii). We were pleased to be able to test the methodology for their Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA), helping it to become more broadly used in the banking sector. The pilot focused on seven sectors including fossil fuel production and power generation of gas, oil and coal, and has allowed us to understand the extent to which our lending activity to carbon-intensive industries is aligned to the two-degree pathway of the Paris Agreement, taking into account the fact that it is focusing on a moment in time.The Impact Series\nBarclays’ thought-leading Impact \nSeries provides analysis and insights on the social impact of economic, \ndemographic and disruptive changes \naffecting markets, sectors and society at large, while commercialising the \nbank’s research product. \nExtending the track record of \nexceptional client response to the Impact Series, the piece titled Oil in \n3D: the demand outlook to 2050 \nand published in May 2019 drove a high volume of client interactions while strengthening Barclays’ leadership position on the topic. \nThe publication analyses whether \nthe world’s estimated oil needs for the next few decades could be compatible with the COP 21 \ncommitment.\nIn particular, the report explores \nthree potential scenarios for global oil demand out to 2050. Modelling differing degrees of government \npolicy and technological innovation, \nthe analysis assesses their impact on future demand. The research concludes that only the most \nambitious scenario, which represents \na step change to the trajectory the world is currently on, will result in the 30% reduction in oil usage that may be required to help curb global \ntemperatures to below the 2°C figure \nagreed at the Paris COP 21.\nThe research is authored by \nLydia Rainforth, a Managing Director \nin Barclays Equity Research team with close to two decades experience in the energy sector. \nPrevious publications have recently \nwon several awards on the 2019 Financial Communications Society Portfolio Awards.CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nStrategy\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 49\nCollaboration across the industry will \nensure that consistent methodology and understanding is developed. Barclays was a member of the UNEP FI TCFD Phase 1 pilot project aimed at developing transition and physical assessment models and metrics to enable scenario-based, forward-looking assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities. In April and July 2018, the Phase 1 Banks published reports detailing the methodologies for scenario-based assessments of transition and physical risks and opportunities. The reports can be found here: \n Extending our Horizons: Assessing \nCredit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate unepfi.org/news/\nthemes/climate-change/extending-\nour-horizons/\n Navigating a New Climate: Assessing \nCredit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate unepfi.org/publications/banking-publications/\nnavigating-a-new-climate-assessing-\ncredit-risk-and-opportunity-in-a-changing-climate/In 2019, Barclays has participated in Phase 2 \nwhich seeks to develop the findings of the first phase. In particular, the Group is engaging with academics and research institutions to better understand the science behind climate change and translate it into decision-useful financial metrics that can inform our future financing activities.\nWe are also a member of the Science Based \nTarget initiative, which is working to develop metrics and methodologies to measure and set targets for alignment with a two-degree world, including accounting protocols for emissions related to financing, banking and investment management activities.2 Degree Investing Initiative PACTA methodology\nIn 2019, Barclays was part of an initial pilot group of 17 international banks road-testing with 2°ii’s Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology\n1 for \nclimate scenario analysis of corporate lending portfolios. The aim of the methodology is to create one approach to assess the alignment of a bank’s corporate lending activities and portfolios with varying future climate change scenarios and ultimately with 2°C scenario benchmarks. The objective of the road testing was to provide feedback and help assess if the methodology could be more broadly used in the banking sector.\nThe PACTA analysis to-date covers seven \nkey climate-relevant industries: Upstream Oil & Gas, Coal Mining, Power generation, Automotive manufacturing, Shipping, Cement & Steel. \nThe methodology utilises information \nfrom Barclays’ loan portfolio (for the seven industries in scope), 2°ii databases which store forward-looking information on capacity or technology utilised by corporates (physical asset-level data) taken from third-party data providers, and finally information from various IEA climate scenarios, condensed to the technology pathways these scenarios prescribe.\nA scenario which PACTA utilises, which \nwe felt most relevant, is the IEA ’s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which predicts a 1.7 -1.8°C in median temperature rise by 2100. The SDS projects that global final energy consumption can stay flat thanks to gains in energy efficiency, despite the doubling in economic output.\nTo illustrate an element of the outputs shared \nby the PACTA tool, the graphic on the right shows how the PACTA methodology divides our loan portfolio for the power sector into a mix of generation technologies. The tool does this by tracking the generation  technology capacity mix for the power companies that we lend to, as well as for forecasts of the change in that mix at those companies over the near-term. It is then possible, using the PACTA tool, to compare our current portfolio with the power generation technology mix in the wider economy for OECD countries. The PACTA tool’s aim is to be able to prescribe targets for the technology mix of a bank’s loan portfolio in future, in order to align lending activities to various scenarios, according to PACTA ’s specific methodology.\nWe recognise that the PACTA methodology \nis still evolving and is, therefore, subject to change. We also recognise that there are also other emerging approaches that aim to assess the alignment of corporate lending portfolios with differing climate scenarios – these various initiatives can differ in the assumptions made about how to link the contribution of specific lending activity with economic activity that impacts on global warming and climate change. Given this is a rapidly evolving field, we may need to further adapt to new insights as they develop. We are committed to this process of refinement and development and will continue to assess available and emerging methodologies and how we can practically apply them. \nDetails on how Barclays has considered its \napproach to alignment with the Paris Agreement can be found on pages 10 to 13.Barclays corporate lending portfolio \nenergy technology mix for power production vs OECD market\n%\nBARCLAYS\nPORTFOLIO\n2019533\n19\nOECD MARKET\n20191618\n9\n436\n17101221\n Renewables\n Nuclear\n Hydro\n Gas\n Oil\n Coal1 Barclays has used the tools and methodology \ndeveloped by 2 Degree Investing Initiative and \nunderlying data provided through their platform. \nThis methodology and the underlying data has \nnot been developed or validated by Barclays.\nThe application of this methodology (or any consequences of such application) shall not be \ninterpreted in any way as conflicting with any \nlegal or contractual obligations.

It considers reports on key financial and legal risk issues and oversees conduct and compliance. It also monitors the Group’s financial, operational and legal risk profile.\nIn 2019, the Committee received an update on \nthe financial and operational risks associated with climate change and endorsed the approach to manage these risks, which included the establishment of a Climate Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk Policy and the inclusion of climate change in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and Principal Risk Frameworks.\nThe Committee also reviewed the significant \nenhancements the Group has made in its approach to managing the risks associated with climate change. Both physical and transition risks across all portfolios were considered in the context of a severe but plausible climate stress. This analysis will support the Group’s response to the forthcoming Bank of England (BoE) industry-wide stress test. This progress was welcomed by the Committee, whilst acknowledging the need for risk management practices generally to evolve further across the industry in respect of climate change risk.\nBarclays Chief Risk Officer has been appointed \nas Senior Manager responsible for climate risk and the Head of Enterprise Risk Management has been made Accountable Executive.\nGroup Risk Committee (GRC) \nGRC reports into the Board Risk Committee. This mandated committee is the most senior risk executive body and is convened to:\n■■Review and monitor the risk profile of a material nature to the Barclays Group.

Within these broad categories we identify a number of factors arising from climate change which we monitor over the short, medium and long- term.\nConnected Risk is the second-order risk arising from physical or transition risk impacts. Connected risk is diverse, impacting consumer and wholesale portfolios. \nThese could be household affordability or recessionary pressures from the rise in credit defaults and sector profitability arising from transition and physical risk. Connected RiskThe transition to a lower carbon economy will involve significant rapid \npolicy, regulatory and legal changes, as evolving technology and markets adapt to a changing climate and associated impacts. \nChanging public sentiment may lead to scrutiny of the business activity, \nleading to reputational damage.\nOver time, campaign and other groups may decide to take legal action \nagainst entities perceived to be contributing to climate change.Transition Risk\nPhysical risks resulting from a changing climate can be event driven (acute risks), including increased severity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, hurricanes and flood. \nLonger term shifts in climate patterns (chronic risks) arise from sustained \nhigher temperatures that may cause rises in sea levels, rising mean temperatures and more severe weather events. \nPotential impacts on GDP , unemployment, food prices, inflation, insurance \ncosts, asset prices and profitability of sectors. Physical damage could \nresult in higher costs and impair asset values.Physical Risk\n■■Rapid policy or regulatory changes  \n(e.g. carbon taxes, tightening of efficiency \nstandards) could lead to increased credit risk associated with clients and counterparties.\n■■Widespread and significant policy changes have not yet occurred but remain a risk now and in the future.\n■■Clients could face potential litigation as a result of the environmental impact of their business activities or their approach to addressing climate change, which could lead to credit risk for the bank where we have exposure to them.\n■■There is some evidence that this is an emerging risk which could continue into the future.■■New evolving and disruptive technologies could lead to substantial and rapid changes in costs of production and operation, competitiveness, supply and demand in certain sectors – which could impact on credit risk associated with clients and counterparties.\n■■The risk of this occurring exists now  \nand in the future.Examples of climate transition risks Examples of climate physical risks\nLegal\nRiskTechnology\nRiskRegulatory\nRisk\nS M L\nS M L\nS M L\nS M LAcute \nPhysical Risk \n(event-driven) ■■This could lead to credit and market risks \nassociated with counterparties  \nand clients.\n■■The bank’s own operational resilience will mitigate against business disruption and damage to assets.\n■■Acute physical events are already occurring in the short term but will likely continue and become more widespread.\nChronic \nPhysical Risk \n(shifts)■■These risks could impact on entire sectors \nand geographic regions that the bank supports, as well as potentially impacting on the bank’s own infrastructure.\n■■These shifts in climate pattern are expected to manifest in the longer-term.Short Term\n0–1 YearsMedium Term\n1–5 YearsLong Term\n5–30 YearsWhen considering climate-related risks, Barclays has categorised short, medium and long term to mean the following timescales:\nM S L\nM L\n52 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nRisk managementCLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nEnvironmental Risk Standard\nIn 2019, the Equator Principles Association \npublished version four of the Equator Principles which introduces, amongst other things, new requirements on sponsors to prepare a Climate Change Risk Assessment aligned with the physical risk and transition risk categories of TCFD. Barclays adherence to the Equator Principles is governed by the Environmental Risk Standard which considers financial risks arising from wider environmental and social issues and is overseen through the transaction review process also described on pages 34 to 35.Enterprise Risk Management \nFramework (ERMF) \nThe ERMF sets the strategic approach for risk \nmanagement by defining standards, objectives and responsibilities for all areas of the Group. \nThe ERMF is complemented by frameworks, \npolicies and standards which are mainly aligned to individual principal risks.\nWithin the ERMF, the Group has a Climate \nChange Standard that corresponds to our latest Climate Change Statement to manage reputation risk. For credit, market, treasury and capital and operational risk, the Group published a ‘Climate Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk Policy’. Climate Change Statement and \nStandard\nIn January 2019, we developed the bank’s first \nEnergy and Climate Change Statement and Standard, which set out our approach to climate change and energy sectors. This is now replaced with an updated, broader Climate Change Statement which sets out our strategic ambition to support economies and clients through the transition that is needed, as well as approach on all sectors relevant to climate change. We have developed an internal standard to reflect these positions in more detail and together with other climate-related Standards (such as the Forestry & Palm Oil Standard), these now determine our approach to climate change and relevant sensitive sectors. These standards sit under the management of reputation risk within the ERMF and are enforced through an existing transaction origination, review and approval process that has been described in more detail on pages 34 to 35. During 2019, we further embedded climate change risk into the Group’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and recognised that climate change, and the associated risks described above, can impact a number of principal risks the Group faces.\n■■Review individual \nobligors’ exposure using \nCredit Climate Lens.\n■■Consider climate \nchange risk appetite in \nrelevant countries and \nportfolios.\n■■Oversight by Retail and Wholesale Risk \nManagement \nCommittees, and Board \nRisk Committee.Credit Risk\nCredit Risk \nAccountable OfficerClimate Change Financial Risk and Operational Risk PolicyEnterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF)\nClimate Change Standard\n■■Assess and identify all \nrisk factors affecting \nclimate change risk.\n■■Apply stress scenarios, \nassess stress losses and \nset risk limits.\n■■Include in ICAAP .\n■■Oversight by Market \nRisk Committee and \nBoard Risk Committee.Market Risk\nMarket Risk \nAccountable Officer■■Assess and aggregate \nexposures to \nclimate-related risks.\n■■Incorporate as part of \nstress testing, capital \nand liquidity planning, \nand non-traded market risk funding processes.\n■■Include in ICAAP and ILAAP .\n■■Oversight by Treasury and Capital Risk \nCommittee and Board \nRisk Committee.Treasury & Capital Risk\nTreasury & Capital Risk \nAccountable Officer■■Integrate climate change across different \nrisk categories e.g. \npremises, supplier.\n■■Include climate change within risk assessment processes including \nstrategic risk \nassessment.\n■■Oversight by Operational Risk Profile \nCommittee and Board \nRisk Committee.Operational Risk\nOperational Risk \nAccountable Officer■■Outline minimum requirements and \ncontrols for reputation \nrisk management \nrelating to client \nrelationships or \ntransactions. \n■■Outline the expected \nbusiness behaviours in \nrelation to these issues.\n■■Outline the approach to \nenhanced due diligence.

The sector provides power, transport and heating, and supports industry, education, health, and livelihoods in communities across the world. \nThe global energy sector is already \nchanging rapidly, embracing new technology, data-driven efficiency solutions, and, increasingly, reliance on renewable energy. Against the backdrop of these trends, we are responding to the needs of our clients operating in the energy sector, supporting their transition to less carbon intensive sources of energy, as well as helping to mitigate and adapt to physical risks which are heightened by climate change. We support our clients to adopt new technologies rapidly, embracing the trend of increasing electrification of the energy system, improving efficiency, and reducing the carbon intensity of their industries.We are especially cognisant of the need for a just transition. The Paris Agreement requires that appropriate financial resources, new technology and an enhanced capacity building framework is put in place to support action by those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The just transition towards an environmentally sustainable economy needs to contribute to the goals of decent work for all, social inclusion and the eradication of poverty. Governments and the private sector have a joint responsibility to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is not carried out at the expense of social welfare, access to employment and associated worker benefits.\nAccording to the commonly used IEA \nscenarios, there will be a significant shift away from carbon based fuel consumption in the long term and we are adapting our financing activity to reflect that change. In particular, we have introduced more stringent restrictions on our support for the thermal coal sector, given the consensus that investment in this fuel type needs to \nend by 2030. \nBarclays is committed to a considered \napproach to clients in sectors with higher carbon-related exposures or emissions from extraction or consumption, or those which may have an impact in certain sensitive environments or on communities. We conduct Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) on a case-by-case basis on clients in these sensitive energy sectors that fall outside explicit restrictions, and will consider the following factors as a minimum:\ni.  The client’s adherence to the Equator \nPrinciples (if a project finance or credit transaction is deemed to be in scope) and relevant International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards;\nii.  The client’s adherence to local and national environmental regulation and standards and industry best practice;\niii.  The client’s management and implementation of procedures which minimise direct environmental impacts in the context of their operations;iv.  The client’s transparent corporate governance and oversight of climate change issues and associated corporate risks, including disclosure against principles such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and appropriate transition plans;\nv.  The client’s approach to and track record in protecting the health and safety of the workforce and local communities;\nvi.  The client’s approach to stakeholder engagement and consultation, including its commitment and adherence to the principles of Free Prior Informed Consent (FPIC) where indigenous peoples may be impacted by their operations; \nvii.  The client’s approach to managing its human rights impacts, including its commitment and adherence to UN Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights where the client uses security personnel. \nIn order to assist and enhance the EDD process, we operate a training programme for credit teams and plan to expand our awareness raising across a wider range of relevant internal audiences throughout 2020.\nExternal technical input may be obtained to \nassist the business in reviewing and assessing whether certain client activities meet our internal EDD criteria, or where there is uncertainty as to whether a certain activity is within scope of our EDD criteria. Barclays will continue to align its approach to sensitive energy sectors with developments in government and public policy.\nSector restrictions\nFor the sector specific restrictions, the following definitions should be applied:\ni)   “Financing”: all lending, underwriting, \nissuance of debt and equity, trade and working capital finance;\nii)  “Directly finance projects” refers to project finance or other lending/underwriting where the use of proceeds is known to be for a particular project.\n54 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nRisk managementCLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nMountain Top  \nRemoval Coal Mining \nMountain Top Removal (MTR) coal \nmining refers to surface coal mining (and the associated reclamation operations) that remove entire coal seams running through the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill, by removing all of the overburden and creating a level plateau or gently rolling contour with no high-walls remaining.\n1 \nBarclays recognises that MTR in the Appalachian region of the USA is a legal mining method, overseen by a robust regulatory framework. MTR has also, however, been subject to intense political, judicial and regulatory debate over the last \ndecade, due to its negative environmental \nand social impacts on one hand, and positive local benefits on the other.\nThe following additional restrictions are in \nplace for clients active in MTR:\n■■ Barclays does not directly finance MTR \nprojects or developments;\n■■ We apply EDD to financing facilities \ninvolving clients which practice MTR.\nArctic Oil and Gas \nArctic oil and gas refers to new exploration and extraction of oil and gas in the area within the Arctic Circle which is subject to sea ice, and includes the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and the Coastal Plains\n2. The ANWR is a particularly fragile \nand pristine ecosystem which is central to the livelihoods and culture of local indigenous peoples. We have therefore introduced the following restrictions:\n■■ We will not directly finance oil and \ngas projects in the Arctic Circle, including but not limited to the ANWR.\n■■In addition, we will not provide any financing to companies primarily engaged in oil and gas exploration and production operations or plan in the Arctic Circle, including but not limited to the ANWR.Coal\nWe are working to adjust our financing portfolio to mirror the trajectory in energy emissions required to meet net zero, taking the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) as our starting point. Our January 2019 Energy and Climate Change Statement outlined our initial restrictions regarding the thermal coal industry, which are still in place as follows: \n■■No project finance to enable the construction or material expansion of coal-fired power stations anywhere in the world;\n■■No project finance for the development of greenfield thermal coal mines anywhere in the world.In recognition of the fact that Barclays needs to go further in the approach taken to this industry, we are also now introducing the following restrictions: \n■■From 2020, we will not provide any financing to clients that generate more than 50% of revenue from thermal coal activities (mining and/or coal fired power generation); \n■■By 2025, we will no longer provide any financing to clients that generate more than 30% of revenue from thermal coal activities; \n■■By 2030, we will no longer provide any financing to clients that generate more than 10% of revenue from thermal coal activities;\n■■We will provide transition finance for companies reducing their thermal coal portfolio (including retro fitting of existing facilities). For those unable to transition their portfolio, we will provide financing for decommissioning plants;\n■■We will also not provide general corporate financing that is specified as being for new or expanded coal mining or coal-fired power plant development.\nRestrictions relating to % revenue generated by clients from thermal coal activities listed above applies to the entity being financed, whether transacting with a group parent, subsidiary or joint venture.\nBy 2030, we will no \nlonger provide any \nfinancing to clients that \ngenerate more than \n10% of revenue from \nthermal coal activities.1 The Surface Mining Control & Reclamation Act (SMCRA 1977), available at gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title30-vol3/\npdf/CFR-2012-title30-vol3-sec716-3.pdf\n2 The Arctic Circle is defined by the National Snow & Ice Data Center, available at nsidc.org/cryosphere/arctic-meteorology/arctic.html\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 55\nOil Sands \nOil sands refers to naturally occurring \ndeposits of water and clay, containing a heavy, viscous oil called bitumen.\nThe development of Canada’s oil sands \nreserves is Canadian government policy and, as such, the Canadian Oil Sands industry is highly regulated. New technology is being actively deployed to extract oil sands and to improve environmental performance. \nIn order to address stakeholder concerns, we \nwill only provide financing to clients who have projects to reduce materially their overall emissions intensity, and a plan for the company as a whole to have lower emissions intensity than the level of the median global oil producer by the end of the decade. This approach takes into consideration the just transition for the workforce and communities currently dependent on the oil sands industry in Canada. We have been in deep discussions with the government of Canada about this and believe that this position, which it supports, is the right position to adopt and the best way of enabling our clients which have operations in the oil sands to participate in transition.\nIn addition to this requirement, any financing \nfor a company involved in the exploration, extraction, transportation (including the construction of pipelines to carry oil sands), or processing of oil sands, is subject to EDD. \nOil sands clients and transactions which \nare subject to EDD must demonstrate consideration of environmental and social impacts and risks (as outlined earlier in this section on page 53) and, in addition, demonstrate the following:\n■■ Compliance with all legal, regulatory and \npermitting requirements in the regions that they operate, showing evidence of any breaches being adequately remediated;\n■■  Management and implementation \nof procedures which minimise direct environmental impacts including land reclamation, air, ground and water pollution, fresh water use, biodiversity protection, and impacts on protected areas such as boreal forests.Hydraulic Fracturing \nHydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, is an oil and gas well development technique, using a high pressure injection of liquid into the rock, which creates fracturing and allows natural gas and oil to flow more freely. Whilst this method of extraction has provided cheaper, more plentiful energy sources for many, it is also a sensitive sector that is of concern for many stakeholders. Impact areas include water consumption and quality, wastewater disposal, air emissions and impacts on local communities, including noise, traffic and seismic changes. Our appetite for doing business with this industry is as follows:\n■■We will not directly finance projects involving fracking in the UK and Europe;\n■■In addition, we will not provide any financing to companies primarily engaged in fracking activities in the UK and Europe;\n■■Any financing for a company involved in fracking activities outside the UK and Europe, is subject to EDD.\nFracking clients and transactions which are subject to EDD must demonstrate consideration of environmental and social impacts and risks (as outlined earlier in this section on page 53) and, in addition, demonstrate the following:\n■■Compliance with legal, regulatory and permitting requirements and remediation plans resulting from any breaches;\n■■GHG emissions management and continuous reduction;\n■■Management of key environmental impacts, including: well construction and maintenance, water use and conservation, waste water management, water pollution management, air emissions management (including flaring);\n■■Engagement with local communities on impacts, including seismic impacts, noise, health and safety.\n56 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nRisk managementCLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nClimate change financial risk \nand operational risk policy \nThis policy introduced climate change as an \noverarching risk impacting certain principal risks: credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk and operational risk. \nThe policy outlines the requirements for \nidentifying, measuring, managing and reporting the impact on Financial and Operational Risks arising from the physical, transition and connected risks associated with climate change.\nThe risks associated with climate change are \nsubject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory and political focus, both in the UK and internationally. Embedding climate risk into the Group’s risk framework in line with regulatory expectations, and adapting the Group’s operations and business strategy to address both the financial risks resulting from the physical risk of climate change and the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy, could have a significant impact on the Group’s business.\nRiskMeasurement approach  for quantifying climate change\nCredit risk The risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to the Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables. \nThe Group manages credit risk under a framework of controls which enable \nthe identification, assessment, measurement and monitoring of credit risk from the level of individual credit facilities up to the total portfolio in each business.\nTransition and physical risks from climate change may lead to credit risks to \nthe Group. This is an evolving risk theme and robust understanding of the risk, severity, level of interconnectedness, and time horizons relating to these risks are developing.A Credit Risk Materiality Matrix (Credit Climate Lens) was introduced in 2019 to understand, assess and manage how climate change may impact the Group’s credit risk exposures. The Credit Climate Lens is a series of questions which is applied to a counterparty to which the Group is exposed in order to assess its climate change risk. \nThe Credit Climate Lens considers transition \nfactors such as a counterparty’s sensitivity to policy changes, reliance on fossil fuels and adaptive strategy, as well as exposure to acute and chronic physical risks. The Credit Climate Lens is applied to clients operating in elevated risk sectors with exposure of more than £5m. Where an obligor is rated as medium or high, the details are referred to the Environmental Risk Management team, a dedicated team in the Group Credit Risk Management function, who conduct enhanced due diligence. \nA lens based review is also applied for portfolio \nand country risk reviews for elevated risk sectors and countries. There are currently over 500 counterparties in scope for the Credit Climate Lens, in sectors most exposed to climate change risks. To support the introduction of the Credit Climate Lens, over 600 credit risk executives were trained on climate change risks.\nMarket risk The risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group’s assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations. \nClimate change may lead to market risk through a disorderly transition to a \nlow-carbon economy or via physical climate events and shifts in supply and demand for financial instruments, which may then impact market prices for susceptible sectors or countries.Stress tests are used to assess and aggregate exposures arising from physical and climate change related risks. Stress test scenarios are applied to a range of assets, reflecting the impact of climate change across sectors, countries and regions.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 57\nRiskMeasurement approach  \nfor quantifying climate change\nTreasury \nand capital  \nriskThis comprises: \nLiquidity risk: the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or \ncontingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. \nCapital risk: the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of \ncapital to support its normal business activities and to meet its r egulatory \ncapital requirements under normal operating environments or stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group’s pension plans. \nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB): the risk that the Group is \nexposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities. \nThe Treasury function manages treasury and capital risk exposure on a \nday-to-day basis with the Group Treasury Committee acting as the principal management body, ensuring that these risks remain acceptable boundaries and thresholds. The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for oversight and provides insight into key capital, liquidity, IRRBB and pension risk management activities. \nThe broad range and severity of risks associated with climate change means \nthat the impacts on Barclays’ capital and liquidity positions in a range of scenarios and time horizons must be considered.Treasury and capital risks are impacted by climate-related risks, primarily in a second order manner. Stress tests using climate change scenarios will be used to assess the impact on Treasury portfolios and the bank’s overall capital position. Climate change narrative and assessment are captured in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP).\nOperational \nriskThe risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, \nhuman factors or due to external events (for example, extreme weather events) where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks.\nBarclays is exposed to climate change risks in its operations, either directly or \nvia the operations of its suppliers. \nThe Group Property Standard outlines Barclays approach to addressing \nenvironmental risks with respect to the availability of operational premises. Additionally, when selecting locations for new strategic sites exposure to extreme weather events is considered. \nOur Resilience programme outlines Barclays requirements (including \nrequirements of its suppliers) to maintain services and respond robustly to business disruption, including if caused by climate-related events. Barclays deploys and validates appropriate business recovery strategies for its critical processes, including the ability to transfer processing to alternative locations or premises. \nFor our suppliers, resilience requirements are articulated through our \nSupplier Control Obligations (SCOs). Each supplier is required to attest to their compliance with the SCOs on an annual basis and further testing is undertaken on a risk based approach.Climate change has been included in the Strategic Risk Assessment to understand exposure on a forward looking basis across the five-year business planning cycle. Operational risk was included in the 2019 exploratory stress test.\n58 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nRisk managementCLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nAssessing resilience of strategy\nScenario analysis and stress testing\nScenario analysis is a critical tool in assessing \nthe future implications of potential climate change pathways on an organisation’s business model. It forms a key part of the TCFD’s recommendation on strategy, guiding organisations to assess their resilience to climate-related issues under a range of uncertainties and future states.\nIn April 2019, the Bank of England published \nits Supervisory Statement on approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change (SS3/19). Consistent with TCFD, this set out regulatory expectations for firms to conduct scenario analysis to inform their strategic planning and determine the impact of the financial risks from climate change on their overall risk profile and business strategy – including the use of scenarios to explore the resilience and vulnerabilities of a firm’s business model to a range of outcomes.\nIn 2018, the United Nations Environment \nProgramme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) brought together a group of 16 banks to develop an approach to scenario analysis that would assess the transition and physical risk inherent in banks’ loan portfolios for certain higher risk sectors. Barclays participated in this pilot exercise and the results can be found in our ESG report from 2019. The modelling approaches developed were bottom-up, analysing impacts at the corporate borrower level. The analysis was based on a tool developed together with Oliver Wyman, which enabled results from the assessment of a representative sample of the portfolio to be used as a benchmark for potential losses in the wider loan portfolio.In 2019 and 2020, we have continued our participation in Phase 2 of the UNEP-FI working group on TCFD. The goals of Phase 2 includes the continued exploration of scenarios, which has involved engagement with the Potsdam institute for Climate Research (PIK) and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). PIK and IIASA develop scenarios using integrated assessment models (IAMs) and are intending to expand the number of scenarios available to include a late transition 1.5° pathway. This pathway would be characterised by disorderly, non-linear macroeconomic transition impacts as a result of a step-change policy response. This scenario expansion will support banks in addressing a critical aspect of scenario analysis; that they cover a reasonable variety of future outcomes, both favourable and unfavourable.\nIn 2019, Barclays undertook a Group-wide \nexploratory stress test using a three year, severe but plausible scenario covering both physical and transitional impacts. We followed a top-down approach utilising the bank’s stress testing capability. We disclose further detail on our exploratory stress test approach in the next section, which we hope will contribute to greater understanding of approaches across the sector.\nIn December 2019, the Bank of England \nannounced it would use its 2021 Biennial Exploratory Scenario (BES) to explore the financial risks posed by climate change. The exercise will test the resilience of the current business models of the largest banks, insurers and the financial system to climate-related risks and therefore the scale of adjustment that will need to be undertaken in coming decades for the system to remain resilient.\nThe Bank of England published a discussion \npaper which detailed their proposed approach. The proposed scope and breadth of the BES will be a pioneering exercise. We are proud to participate in this exercise and we hope that our combined effort will encourage other central banks to build upon these first steps to understand and mitigate our shared global challenge.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 59\nGroup-wide Exploratory Climate Stress Test 2019\nDuring 2019, Barclays conducted a Group-\nwide, exploratory stress test against a severe but plausible near-term climate scenario. The aim of the analysis was to identify key vulnerabilities that were most relevant and material to Barclays’ business model and geographical footprint.\nOur key objective was to understand the \nvulnerability of the bank should global financial systems experience a significant market shock triggered by sudden policy action on climate change.\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) have adopted four representative concentration pathways (RCP) as part of their goal in providing an objective and scientific view of climate change. These range from a high transition scenario where global temperatures are contained to 2.3ºC (RCP2.6) to a world whereby carbon emissions continue at current rates and temperatures increase beyond 3ºC (RCP8.5). The approach to our stress test aligns most closely to the RCP2.6 pathway.\nApproach\nThe approach utilised our existing stress testing capabilities and climate risk framework to help us identify potential vulnerabilities and key areas of focus.\nWe first designed a three-year scenario \nwhich was intended to be severe but plausible in light of the current global political and economic environment. The scenario began in 2019 and evolved over a three-year time horizon. We then considered how each phase of the scenario could impact Barclays’ portfolios and principal risks, including running sensitivity analysis on key assumptions made and on the most impacted areas. \nLastly, we considered each loss event in \nturn and whether there were any notable second-order feedbacks that could exacerbate losses identified in other areas of the bank. \n1.

Public opinion rapidly shifts in response leading to a sharp revaluation of assets, with carbon-intensive sectors particularly impacted. These combine to force governments to introduce wide ranging, but fragmented policy changes, which lead to broader macroeconomic impacts.\nA range of economic variables were \nsourced from the PRA ’s 2019 Life Insurance stress test.\nKey assumptions\nThis stress testing exercise was exploratory in nature, we made a number of key assumptions partly to simplify the exercise, but also where they were consistent with the severity and plausibility of the scenario narrative. Sensitivity analysis of key climate-based assumptions highlighted the below as the most notable:\n■■No material climate events occur outside of our key physical locations;\n■■The Thames Barrier is sufficient to prevent wide-spread flooding across the City of London; and\n■■Major household insurance providers remain solvent throughout the forecast horizon. \nPhysical impacts\n■■Widespread issues of flooding across the UK impacted the valuation of flood-prone residential and commercial property, including Barclays-owned real estate, and led to an increase in default rates across our Home Finance and Business Banking (primarily Agriculture) portfolios.\n■■A historically late and severe hurricane season on the US southern and eastern coastlines led to a significant increase in property damage and subsequent spike in insurance claims across impacted states, affecting the credit quality of certain non-life insurance companies and local municipalities.\n■■The impact of severe weather in India affected Barclays’ business operations, albeit resilience plans negated major disruption or loss. Transition impacts\n■■The rapid transition to a low carbon economy impacted the credit quality and funding requirements of clients within carbon-intensive sectors, particularly those exposed to i) changes in regulatory, supervisory and climate policies; ii) shift in technology towards less carbon intensive products; and iii) behavioural changes from shifting consumer demand patterns.\n■■The response within financial markets was a decline in equity, credit and securitised product valuations across key sectors, affecting the valuation of assets measured at fair value, including those held in the trading book, leverage finance underwrites, equity positions held as principal investments, assets held for liquidity purposes and investments within Barclays’ pension fund. \nConnected impacts\nAs a result of this analysis, we identified second order (or ‘connected’) risks whereby:\n■■The higher cost of carbon in certain sectors, including utilities, was then passed through to the end consumer resulting in an increase in energy prices. This in turn reduced the affordability and credit quality of our retail customers in the UK and US.\n■■The connected impact of all the above loss events ultimately led to higher unemployment and recessionary pressures in developed economies. This resulted in an increase in impairment across all portfolios and geographies, a reduction in net interest income from lower balances, albeit partially offset by slightly higher rates to combat inflationary pressures, and lower fees from banking products.Outcome \nClimate risk is an emerging risk and as such, there is currently no defined approach across the banking industry for identifying, measuring, aggregating and reporting climate risks. As a result, the approach we have taken for this stress test is the first step on that journey and our techniques will naturally evolve over time. Whilst the outcome of any forecast is inherently uncertain, there will be more uncertainty within these results than more traditional macroeconomic-based scenarios. The losses displayed below are approximations only and should be treated with a high-level of caution given the caveats mentioned above. \nClimate risk P&L \ncontribution \nby risk type \nPhysical 4%\nTransition 49%\n– of which relates to higher Corporate downgrades and defaults in elevated-risk sectors 20%\n– of which relates to market-related movements 22%\n– of which relates to other impacts, such as higher operating costs 7%\nConnected 47%\nTotal 100%\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 61\nThe approximate capital impact was \ncomfortably within that observed as part of the Bank of England’s 2019 Annual Cyclical Scenario and primarily driven by transition and connected risks. Barclays’ risk profile is well positioned in relation to short-term physical events; however, we recognise that longer-term scenarios will be required to assess a greater range of impacts, most notably the physical implications of global temperature increases that go beyond those committed to as part of the Paris Climate Accord.Climate risk is complex and the industry is at the beginning of a journey to understand physical risks and impacts on our clients and exposures over time. For example, as part of this stress test, we undertook a deep dive review of our UK mortgage portfolio where we were able to assess the flood risks associated with our home loans using data from the UK Government’s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). This analysis, using granular postcode level data within England, found that a small portion of our credit exposure currently falls in high or medium risk zones. However, we recognise we will need to understand how this profile may change under different scenarios over longer time horizons.\nAs at 31 December 2019 DescriptionGross loans \nand advances\nBarclays UK\nHigh risk Each year, there is a chance of flooding of greater than \n1 in 30 (3.3%). 479\nMedium risk Each year, there is a chance of flooding of between than 1 in 30 (3.3%) and 1 in 100 (1%). 1,691\nLow risk Each year, there is a chance of flooding of between than 1 in 100 (1%) and 1 in 1000 (0.1%). 2,701\nVery low risk Each year, there is a chance of flooding of less than 1 in 1000 (0.1%). 6,097\nKey learnings and next steps\nThis Group-wide climate change risk stress testing exercise was a useful means for the bank to continue to explore the use of its existing risk management and assessment infrastructure to assess climate change risk and to continue to build the capabilities of different teams within the bank who are responsible for understanding and assessing risk.\nFollowing the publication of the Bank of \nEngland discussion paper in December 2019, on stressing the UK financial system to climate-related risks – Barclays will participate in the Bank of England’s Biennial Exploratory Scenario on climate-related risks. Work is progressing to enhance our capabilities in order to meet the proposals set out in the Discussion Paper, leveraging work already undertaken during 2019 to support this going forward.We recognise that supervisors and regulators globally will increasingly move in the direction of requiring assessments of climate-related risks, including using stress testing tools. As climate change is a global issue, we believe a global assessment makes the most sense and we welcome increasing co-ordination between regulators on this issue, for example in terms of scenario development and modelling approaches, through bodies including the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).The table below details gross loans and advances to the UK Home Finance portfolio only for clients classified by DEFRA as being in a flood risk postcode, the majority of these are in postcodes classified as being very low risk.\n62 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nAs a bank and financial intermediary we are \ncommitted to exploring metrics which we can use to assess the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities in our lending portfolio and wider financing activities.\nOur involvement with a number of \norganisations and working groups such as the UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), the Institute of International Finance (IIF), UK Finance and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) aims to develop appropriate definitions and metrics for the sector. \nAreas of focus include, amongst others, clarity \nover detailed definitions of carbon-related assets building on the TCFD high-level guidance; standardised methods for the calculation and presentation of credit exposure to carbon related assets; definitions for climate-related and green financing across product categories; and suitable risk management metrics. \nWe are also involved in collaborative projects \nto develop accounting protocols for emissions related to financing, banking and investment management. \nAs disclosures develop, we would expect \nfurther dialogue over time between banks, corporates, investors and other market participants on appropriate, decision-useful and robust metrics to assess climate-related risks and opportunities and the development of portfolio alignment approaches and metrics. Enhanced quantitative \ndisclosures for 2019 \nBarclays has significantly enhanced our \nreporting against the suggested TCFD guidelines including the supplemental guidance for banks. In some instances, we provide additional detail aligned to our approach, which may go beyond the approach suggested by TCFD. \nMetrics include a range of internal and \nexternal measures including balance sheet credit exposures, financing facilitated, operational emissions and performance in external climate change and environmental benchmarks. \nCredit exposures \nBarclays is committed to understanding the risks associated with sectors sensitive to the impacts from climate change. Disclosing risk management metrics and quantitative credit exposures supports this approach and our ongoing alignment with the TCFD recommendations. The following sectors represent those that the Group considers at an elevated risk from the impacts of climate change, and cover a broader range of sectors beyond energy and utilities. However, in each sector there will exist a range of vulnerabilities and as such these figures do not represent elevated carbon emission exposures and should not be interpreted as an indicator of relative carbon intensity. These sectors have been identified through an analysis of Barclays Industrial Classifications by portfolio and benchmarked against Moody’s and other external sources, with additional input from subject matter experts. \nOverview of credit exposures by \nindustry sector ‘Manufacturing’, ‘energy and water’, ‘wholesale and retail distribution’ and ‘other’ are those standard categories, as disclosed in the Annual Report, that have been identified to contain exposures at an elevated risk from the impacts of climate change.

It outlines the Purpose and Values that govern our way of working across our business globally and constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues’ working relationships, specifically (but not exclusively) with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments and regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community. It is aligned to the Code of Professional Conduct, published by the Chartered Banker Professional Standards Board, which sets out the ethical and professional attitudes and behaviours expected of bankers. Barclays subscribes to this code and is committed to embedding its broad principles into our business.\nThe Barclays Way includes information and \nguidance on how employees are expected to behave and take personal accountability for making decisions. We apply a range of criteria, over and above financial considerations, aimed at building a sustainable, strong and profitable business for the long term and \nadding value to our business relationships \nand the broader communities in which we live and work. We provide guidance across key stakeholder groups, including service for customers and clients, promoting respect, diversity and performance in the workplace, maintaining strong governance, robust controls and strict ethical standards. \nThe Barclays Way also includes advice and \nguidance on speaking up and raising concerns. It is important for the success of Barclays, and the safety and well-being of our customers, clients and colleagues, that we encourage a culture which supports speaking up when things aren’t as they should be. All colleagues are required to undertake training on the Barclays Way.\nIt is available on our website at: home.\nbarclays/citizenship/the-way-we-do-business/code-of-conduct/Our commitment to being a responsible \nbusiness includes:\n■■ensuring we conduct ourselves in line with our code of conduct – The Barclays Way,\n■■ensuring that we treat our customers fairly and that the products and services we deliver are transparent and responsible, \n■■improving customer experiences,\n■■ensuring we operate in line with relevant laws and regulations including those applicable to financial crime,\n■■and ensuring we safeguard the data which has been entrusted to us.\nThe Barclays Way\nOur code of conduct reflects the trust that millions of people place in us every day. We know that trust is earnt by repeatedly doing the right thing. We believe the best way to build that trust is to invest in our culture and support our people in the choices they make every day with guidance and policies that help.\nThat starts with our Purpose and our Values, \nand is locked into our organisation through The Barclays Way; the touchstone for everyone in Barclays on the standard of conduct we expect, which sets an unequivocal tone from the top about who we are and what we stand for.Employee survey results\n“I believe my team and I role model \nthe Values”\n20182019\n9392\nBarclays UK net promoter  \nscore (NPS®)1\n+14\n2017+17\n2018+18\n2019\nThe NPS® is a view of how willing customers are to \nrecommend our products and services to others.\nThe Barclays Way – \nour Code of Conduct \n– was launched in 2013, \nreplacing existing codes \nof conduct with a single \ndocument.

Resolution of these matters remains a necessary and important part of delivering the Group’s strategy and an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct.\nTrading entity Board Risk Committees and \nsenior management received Conduct Dashboards setting out key indicators in relation to Conduct, Financial Crime, Culture and Complaints. These continue to be evolved and enhanced to allow effective oversight and decision-making. Barclays has operated at the overall set tolerance for Conduct risk throughout 2019. The tolerance adherence is assessed by the business areas through key indicators which are aggregated and provide an overall rating which are reported to the relevant Board level Committees as part of the Conduct Dashboard.\nWe remain focused on the continuous \nimprovements being made to manage risk effectively with an emphasis on enhancing governance and management information to identify risk at earlier stages.\nPlease see the Conduct Risk management and \nperformance sections in the 2019 Annual Report for more information.\nSee the report of the Board Reputation \nCommittee in the Director’s Report for further information on Board oversight of culture and conduct matters and Committee activity in 2019.\n See the Pillar 3 Report for further detail \non Risk management strategy, governance and risk cultureManaging conduct risk\nBarclays Group defines, manages and \nmitigates Conduct risk with the goal of providing positive customer and client outcomes, protecting market integrity and promoting effective competition. This includes taking reasonable steps to ensure that our culture and strategy are appropriately aligned to these goals; its products and services are reasonably designed and delivered to meet the needs of customers and clients; promoting the fair and orderly operation of the markets in which Barclays Group does business; and that Barclays Group does not commit or facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery and corruption, or breaches of economic sanctions. Product Life cycle, Culture and Strategy and Financial Crime are the risk categories within the Barclays Group definition of Conduct risk. \nBarclays is committed to continuing to drive \nthe right culture throughout all levels of the organisation. The Group will continue to enhance effective management of conduct risk and appropriately consider the relevant tools, governance and management information in decision-making processes. Focus on management of conduct risk is ongoing and amongst other relevant business and control management information the Trading Entity Conduct Dashboards are a key component of this.\nThe Group continues to review the role and \nimpact of Conduct Risk Events and issues in the remuneration process at both the individual and business level.\nBusinesses have continued to assess the \npotential customer, client and market impacts of strategic change. As part of the 2019 medium-term planning process, material conduct risks associated with strategic and financial plans were assessed.\nThroughout 2019, Conduct risks were raised \nby each business area for consideration by relevant Board level Committees.These Committees reviewed the risks raised and whether management’s proposed actions were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively.Culture and conduct\nWe believe that the stronger our culture, the better the choices our people will make – and the stronger our business will be for all our stakeholders.\nOur culture also helps us to reduce the impact \nof poor conduct on our customers. We do not intend to repeat the errors of the past.\nOur most senior leaders spend significant \ntime setting the right tone at Barclays, and our Purpose and Values are now deeply embedded in their message. \nWe are investing in the skills of our leaders \nthroughout the organisation as well, with two new leadership programmes helping us to develop the culture carriers of the future. For more details see the People and culture section on pages 81 to 87.\nWe also strengthen our culture with clear \nand effective controls. We continue to see a marked improvement in the number of operational risk events and compliance breaches. Our aspiration for both of these is zero and we will continue to invest in making our controls better still.\nWe are investing in the \nskills of our leaders \nthroughout the \norganisation as well, \nwith two new \nleadership programmes \nhelping us to develop \nthe culture carriers of the future.Conduct\n70 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nRUNNING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\nProduct life cycle\nIt is important that our products and services \nmeet the needs of clients, customers, markets and the bank, throughout their life cycle. We do this by operating two processes which together enable our product life cycle management framework. \nFirstly, we have a process that supports the \nbank in the implementation of new and amended products and services. This process outlines the requirements that must be met in order to ensure that new and amended products and services are adequately designed prior to their launch. \nSecondly, we have a complementary process \nthat reviews the existing portfolio of products and services. These reviews consider a range of relevant information about the performance and operation of the product or service, such as: volumes, risk events, customer feedback, complaints and account closures. If issues are found, remedial action is taken to address them. \nThese processes are overseen by the Risk \nFunction of the bank. Customer communications \nIt is important that our engagement with our customers is open and honest and that we treat them fairly to make sure they are not harmed, exploited or misled. Barclays continues to ensure that our customers’ needs and priorities are understood before making recommendations and that the communications we provide allow informed decisions to be made. This is achieved through a number of controls which focus on ensuring our customers receive clear information in order to understand the risks and benefits of the products we offer. For example:\n■■Communications are sufficient for, targeted and distributed to recipients whom Barclays knows or reasonably believes may stand to benefit from the communication, and are communicated in a manner and style that will be understood by the average recipient (or likely recipient); and\n■■Communications are withdrawn from further circulation when they are no longer accurate or fit for purpose.\nRemediation and redress\nBarclays recognises that customer detriment may occur as a result of our error, actions or inactions, and that we must undertake appropriate activity to ensure our customers are put back in the position they would have been in had the issue not occurred.\nRemediation can be proactive, where we have \nidentified the issue ourselves (for example through identifying a pattern in customer complaints), or reactive, where identified by a third party such as a Barclays regulator. \nBarclays operates consistent principles for \nremediation which includes timely notification to the relevant regulatory bodies. Conduct\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 71\nHow our business lines approach conduct\nBarclays UK \nConsumer Banking \nCustomer led design \nGood design emphasises the usefulness of a product or proposition, which is why it’s important to underpin each with customer insights in order to deliver the right outcome for the customer. To achieve this, we have adopted an approach centred in customer design to bringing new propositions to market.\n■■We start with the ‘who’, understanding the customer to grasp what really matters to them and what they are trying to achieve, spending time in research labs and with customers at home or their place of work, to immerse ourselves in the problem statement, pain points and needs. \n■■This is followed by the ‘what’ in conceptual design, mapping the end to end journey as a customer would see and experience it, drawing out the key emotional touch points so we can create the right experience for the circumstance the customer is in.\n■■Before any concept moves into development, we aim to test the design with different customer groups to validate the output, but more importantly to incorporate feedback and adapt the final design so every aspect of a proposition is grounded in deep customer insights.\nReward and incentivesSince June 2019, a new reward scheme has been in place, incentivising all BUK colleagues to collaborate across the business to better serve our customers. All BUK colleagues now receive an annual payment relating to one shared objective: to improve the customer experience. We measure our progress and define payment levels through the use of a brand level Net Promoter Score.\nIn addition to this change, our customer \nfacing colleagues working for Branch, Virtual Channels, Mortgages, Advocacy, Wealth Client Management Services, Business and Premier Banking have also seen the majority of their former reward budget rolled into a permanent base salary increase. This change provides more financial security for colleagues, reducing the risk of our reward structure being misaligned with the needs and desires of our customers. Product designOne of the key purposes of the Product Review process is to ensure alignment with our Product and Service Design Principles. These include requirements that:\n■■The product or service meets a clear, unique and genuine customer need;\n■■Customers are able to exit or downgrade from the product or product elements with minimal difficulty or cost;\n■■An option to cancel without cost within a ‘cooling off’ period is standard, and there is minimal difficulty or cost to cancel or switch after this period has ended;\n■■Customer vulnerability is considered and the risk of causing customer detriment is mitigated.\nThe Product Review process also covers matters including:\n■■Product parameters, including target markets, client segments, ongoing suitability and whether the product or service remains consistent with the needs, characteristics and objectives of the identified target market;\n■■Benefits versus best interests to customers and client, and the business;\n■■Features of the product or service;\n■■Distribution channels;\n■■Financial Risks as relevant to the customer or client and market integrity; \n■■Post-sale transactional services where there is potential for customer, client or market detriment;\n■■Relevant supporting infrastructure and controls including data, resilience and technology;\n■■Any potential issues identified.\nWherever a product or service is found not to be meeting these principles, the product or service owner must ensure that actions are taken to address this. The actions are validated by functional areas, including Legal and Compliance. \nFair pricing\nOur pricing principles commit to ensuring \nthat customers are paying a fair price for the \nproducts and services they are receiving and an ongoing review of the suitability of these products is conducted through Group Product Reviews.\nWe have conduct considerations embedded \nin the Barclays Pricing Framework, in particular our commitment to treating customers fairly and that our pricing practices do not cause poor customer outcomes.We benchmark our rates against competitors and are committed to encouraging a healthy level of competition and switching, which in turn benefits customers through increased choice, lower costs and encourages greater product innovation.\nIn the previous Product Review process, a \n‘Value for Money’ assessment was undertaken; in the new process this has been replaced with a series of questions around pricing, including:\n■■How does this product or service generate income?\n■■Does the product have a complex price structure that makes total cost difficult to understand?\n■■Are there any fees or charges significantly above the cost of the service or disproportionally in favour of the bank?\n■■How are changes to fees or rates communicated to customers and clients?\n■■Has the product relied on a zero, low upfront or fixed charges, but has high per usage charges?\n■■Are there features or add-ons that customers pay for as part of this product that are not used by the majority of customers and clients?\n■■Have there been any temporary or short term promotions or offers?\n■■Are there introductory offers or fees?\nGovernance and reportingGovernance around product review has been strengthened. Under the new Product Review process, a Product Review Committee operates monthly, giving senior management oversight of outputs of all product reviews. Output of product reviews will be rated according to the bank-wide standard risks and issues classification matrix; once the Committee has approved the risk assessment, any risks rated High or Exceptional must be escalated to the relevant Risk Committee. Any actions arising from the product reviews are managed through the Barclays Risk Acceptance and Issues Management Standard, with all associated issues and actions being presented to the Product Review Committee.\n72 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nBusiness Banking \nWe aim to continually improve the conduct \nand culture of our business with particular focus on improving colleague engagement and the colleague experience, the importance of diversity and inclusion and a continuous focus on positive customer outcomes. Underpinning all this is our control environment which ensures that any problems are quickly identified and escalated, with robust decision making processes in place to resolve the issues. Alongside the rest of the Group, we have introduced a Culture Dashboard which is a framework to assess what the current culture is and how it evolves.\nWe regularly review our products and \npropositions to ensure they are fit for purpose and meet our client needs. There are robust processes in place to ensure any new products or services are thoroughly reviewed to ensure client and conduct considerations are at the forefront. We have relaunched our Pathway to Purchase approach to ensure that client needs are fully explored, product options fully considered and product terms and conditions are transparent. This is supported by quality assurance testing and underpinned by greater use of data and insights delivered via Salesforce to inform and support front line colleagues. Throughout 2019, significant improvements have been introduced across lending, through a combination of simplification of operational procedures and processes, enhancements to lending automation and better controls. In this way, we have delivered great customer outcomes for both simple and complex lending. \nWealth\nOur aim is to integrate banking, planning and investments in one place while leveraging the Barclays customer base and UK customer app. We’re simplifying investments and opening up advice and the tools that we use to support our wealthiest clients to more people. Our Wealth Managers will be empowered with the latest technology, freeing them up to focus on the more complicated ‘moments that matter’, whilst also giving Wealth clients an excellent digital experience.Barclays International \nConsumer, Cards & Payments \nEnhancing product governance and oversight Ensuring our products remain fit for purpose and valued by our customers continues to be a priority. In 2019 we have introduced more rigour to our product review and analysis processes through introducing a service assessment and new controls around triggers and regular product monitoring of key customer outcomes. Cards & Payments has a total of 54 Product Families and 231 products. \n2019 enhancements included review trigger \nmonitoring which resulted in an out of cycle Product Review for the UK Payments SmartPay Hub. The product was removed \nfrom the market to ensure sales processes \nwere fair, balanced and well monitored. The product will be relaunched to new customers in 2020. In the US Timeshare sector, enhancements have been made to ensure training materials for sales agents include important information such as complaints processes and communication channels for customers to report concerns or raise questions. \nStrengthening product design through \ninnovationUK Payments – Commercial Payments (BCP):\nBCP provides solutions that address the \nprocess and working capital challenges that firms often face when making business-to-business (B2B) payments. BCP has recognised this customer need and has responded by creating a family of analytical tools that deliver a data driven case for change, helping organisations make informed decisions when considering whether to use our solutions. Many customers are already benefiting from Accounts Payables (AP) and Value Calculators capability and have given positive feedback on the innovative way they can visually understand the specifics of their supplier base.Strengthening sales processes, including third party sales:Barclays Partner Finance (BPF):\nBPF rolled out functionality of ‘Sign \nAnywhere’ to the majority of clients, for BPF to get positive affirmation direct from the customer that they have been provided with the required information (including terms and conditions) to ensure they understand the product that they are agreeing to and to open channels for discussion and the resolution of concerns or questions. \nBPF sends a SMS survey to all customers to \ncheck if they have any concerns about the finance product that they purchased or the way it was sold to them. This provides BPF with the ability to identify and address any customer concerns much earlier in the customer journey. It also helps identify concerns about client behaviours that can then be addressed and filtered into improved sales processes, training and procedures on an ongoing basis – resulting in continuous improvement to the client experience and outcomes. \nBPF has enhanced the monitoring of the \nfinancial viability and strength of all clients to improve the likelihood that partners will be able to honour their commitments to joint customers.\nSupporting customers through challenging \ntimesUS Consumer Bank:\nWe have focused on supporting customers \nthrough difficult challenges including Hurricane Florence and other natural disasters through the ‘Be Safe’ programme, through providing focused and additional support, waiving of fees and temporary credit card limits, delayed payment waivers and through proactively supporting and responding to customers’ concerns and needs as events have unfolded. This is a model the US business now embeds into day to day operations to continue to focus on supporting customers through times of challenge. \nUK Payments – Business and Commercial \nPayments:We proactively identified a significant customer and client impact as a result of the collapse of Thomas Cook. The business implemented a robust, empathetic and collaborative process across both the businesses to focus on helping to make life easier for both customers and clients. Additional support for customers was made available to process chargebacks and to manage/support on specific issues. RUNNING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\nConduct\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 73\nUse of analytics to continuously improve \ncustomer experience and outcomes:Barclays Partner Finance:\nBPF made improvements to our Buy Now Pay \nLater (BNPL) product to improve the upfront explanation of the product to customers and to rebate interest on partial payments made in the deferral period. This was in direct response to customer feedback and internal analysis being performed on an ongoing basis to assess and spot indicators that customers may have suffered detriment, which resulted in remediation where detriment was identified.\nPrivate Banking and Overseas Services \nProduct design and fair value In 2019, we rolled out training on Product Lifecycle and Annual Product Review standards to the product managers, which is repeated on at least an annual basis. This has improved communications aimed at helping clients make informed decisions on the risks and benefits of the products we are offering.\nSales quality and customer trades\nOur sales quality standards are designed to ensure we fully understand our clients’ risk profiles, circumstances, investment needs and objectives. The Private Bank Training & Competency (T&C)/Supervision and Advice Quality Assessment processes ensures that our client advisers are qualified, trained and competent to perform their regulated roles and able to provide suitable and appropriate investment advice to our clients. Best Execution monitoring is carried out on trades and reported into the Best Execution Oversight Forum. We ensure that clients are put at the heart of everything we do; we recognise when customer detriment may have occurred and we undertake appropriate activity, including following complaints handling and redress procedures, to ensure our clients are put back in the position they should have been in.Managing front-line employeesThe Private Bank T&C / Supervision scheme ensures regulated or relevant employees’ skills, knowledge and performance are regularly assessed, their competence is maintained and their skills are regularly developed.\nConduct of in scope front-line employees \nagainst key testing and metrics is presented in the Conduct Dashboard, ensuring conduct issues are captured and discussed regularly.\nOur Client Experience Forum drives specific \njourney reviews and detailed complaints root cause analysis.\nAnnual Mandatory Training on conduct \nbehaviours for all front-line employees is delivered to ensure best practices are shared and rules and regulations are adhered to.\nCorporate and Investment Bank \nMarkets and Banking \nThe Markets, Banking and BI Treasury Product Governance Forum oversees the Product Governance Framework. This provides an ongoing product review process, which promotes the delivery of products to compatible end investors on a direct and indirect basis. In addition, the Forum has oversight of supplementary point of sale and post-sale processes and controls defined by each business and tailored in line with their specific client base and products offered. The Forum provides review, challenge and guidance and facilitates the consistent application and information sharing between the Markets, Banking and BI Treasury Businesses. This ensures improving governance in line with the Firm’s overall risk management framework. \nThe Retail Distribution Forum (RDF) is a \nregional forum that reviews new transactions, distribution strategies, product features and governance frameworks that apply to Retail Structured Products (RSPs), particularly focusing on the suitability element. There are further quarterly mandatory meetings to review all approvals in the previous quarter, provide an upcoming view of future meetings and a regulatory update. Distributor Due Diligence and Tiering & Interview Frameworks help the business to review and monitor our clients who service end-retail investors, to help ensure that our clients have robust procedures focused on ensuring good end-customer outcomes.\nOur Post Sales Monitoring process allows \nclients to log into BARX at their convenience and review ISINs which have been flagged based upon their performance according to the parameters defined in our framework. \nProduct research and design in the \nCorporate Bank We bring customers into our proposition development processes through research, insight, data analytics and data science by ensuring their needs are at the core of our design principles. We leverage the new product approval process to ensure customer needs are embedded in the final product design.\nNet Promoter Score (NPS\n®)1, an industry \nrecognised customer-focused metric, is built \ninto our collective reward to help facilitate a customer-centric culture.\n1  Net Promoter, Net Promoter System, Net Promoter Score, NPS® and the NPS® related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems, Inc.\n74 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nComplaints \nIn Barclays UK, we continue to focus on \nimproving our customer experience by supporting the removal of the root causes of customer complaints. Our underlying complaint volumes (excl. Payment Protection Insurance related complaints) in 2019 reduced by 6% year-on-year, supported by improvements made in our general day-to-day Banking complaints. However PPI related complaints increased 182% year-on-year as we approached the FCA deadline on PPI complaints. This resulted in the overall Barclays UK total complaint volumes increased by 78% in 2019 compared with 2018.\nFor more information see:  \nhome.barclays/citizenship/our-\nreporting-and-policy-positions/uk-complaints-data\nBarclays International complaint volumes have \nshown a 6% reduction year on year, driven by a 7% reduction within our Cards and Payments business (who make up 96% of total BI complaints). We continue to focus on improving our customer experience by supporting the removal of the root causes of customer complaints, with further reductions in volume remaining a significant priority. In order to make a credit decision we generally look at a number of factors including the complexity of the customer, account behaviour, business and financial risk and Barclays’ risk appetite given sector and client risk profile. We have regular monitoring in place to oversee performance. Where customers fall behind on their payments, our Barclays Financial Assistance area is able to support, with a strong focus on ensuring good customer outcomes.\nBuilding financial well-being\nAs part of our aim to deliver a world class money management experience and help money work for our customers, we are delivering more tools and features that give back greater control and educate them around managing their money to improve their financial well-being: \n■■We are providing knowledge and expertise through our colleagues to upskill our customers, whether that be in using our digital platforms via Digital Eagles, or educating them on basic money management via our Money Mentors, LifeSkills programme and Barclays Money Management hub. \n■■We are improving our ability to interpret customer data and provide personalised, proactive money management information so customers get a better grasp on their spending behaviours and how they can feel more in control of their money.\n■■We are delivering colleague training to help support customers when they are in vulnerable situations and provide the suitable tools to help.\nVulnerable customersIt is likely that all of our customers could become vulnerable at some point in their life, which is why Barclays UK puts a huge focus on protecting customers and supporting those who find themselves in difficult times. From disability and mental ill-health, through to domestic abuse and homelessness, our strategy takes into account the barriers vulnerable people may face in accessing finance, through to helping those who are trying to get back on their feet following a setback. We train our front line teams to identify a customer’s circumstances, respond with empathy, and work with them to achieve a positive outcome. We may use data to try and identify where customers may be potentially vulnerable, reaching out to offer support, or provide expert training to specialist teams so that people with specific issues can get through to colleagues with the right expertise and skills. We also use technology to identify new ways to help vulnerable customers, such as our improved debit card setting which can let customers restrict spend with certain merchants or turn off ATM withdrawals.We believe that transparency of information in our products and services is key to empowering consumers to make good financial decisions. \nWe carefully consider the requirements of \nall our stakeholders during the development of products and services. This includes a commitment to accessibility and inclusion, giving customers the ability to take control of their finances in a manner convenient to them and the promotion of financial capability.\nSelected front line staff are trained to identify \nsigns that customers are encountering financial difficulties, and where necessary we work with our customers to enable them to return to financial health. An example of this is the new training and tools that have been rolled out within our branch network to \nenable colleagues to better support customers \npresenting with financial difficulties. We also have information available for customers through our money management hub, providing tangible examples of how banks can support customers who are worried about their finances.\nIn our Unsecured Lending business, which is \nwhere customers can borrow money without offering up a security based on a major asset, we are ensuring that our customers use their lending facilities in a sustainable way. To this purpose, we have been communicating with customers deemed to be in persistent debt to support them to repay their debt faster and so reduce their overall interest charges. Strategic changes are being designed and implemented to prevent more customers entering this situation and to help those in that situation to pay down their outstanding balance. \nWithin our Retail business the card controls \nwithin our mobile app enable customers to block payments to certain categories of retailer, such as gambling services and premium rate phone lines, as well as daily cash machine withdrawal limits and control on online and phone purchases. \nWhere customers fall behind on their \npayments, our Barclays Financial Assistance area is able to support, with a strong focus on ensuring good customer outcomes.\nIn the Business Bank we have a series of policies \nin place to ensure we comply with relevant regulation, mitigate the risk of defaulting for customers undergoing challenging circumstances and provide a framework for impairment, provisioning and forbearance. \nBUK complaints\n000s\n2018 2017 2016 2019 \n6008501,1001,3501,600BUK formed\n-2% -2%+78%\nBUK (excl.

We also expect the same from our agents and third parties providing services for or on our behalf. We comply with the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 and all applicable tax evasion/tax evasion facilitation laws wherever we do business. We have an Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation Standard which addresses the risks associated with customers, employees and third parties acting for or on behalf of Barclays.\nSanctions\nSanctions are restrictions on activity with targeted countries, governments, entities, individuals and industries that are imposed by bodies such as the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), individual countries or groups of countries. The Barclays Financial Crime Policy and the associated Sanctions Standard are designed to ensure that:\n■■Barclays and its employees know how to identify and manage the risks associated with sanctions, including the risk of Barclays’ products being used to contravene sanctions\n■■All Barclays businesses and legal entities comply with applicable sanctions laws in every jurisdiction in which we operate.\nThe Barclays policy positions on \nfinancial crime can be found at: \nhome.barclays/citizenshiphome.barclays/content/  \ndam/home-barclays/documents/\ncitizenship/our-reporting-and-\npolicy-positions/policy-positions/\nbarclays-financial-crime-statement-2019.pdfBarclays conducts comprehensive financial \ncrime risk assessments on a regular basis (minimum annually), incorporating bribery and corruption, money laundering, sanctions and tax evasion facilitation.\nThis covers all operations globally, divided \ninto 89 assessment units along business, functional and geographical lines. The risk assessment is overseen by the Financial Crime Team which monitors the completion of action plans to mitigate key risks identified.\nWe have a comprehensive global financial \ncrime training programme which includes mandatory general awareness training delivered via the Barclays learning management system. This training is further supplemented by role-specific enhanced financial crime training (online, paper-based or face to face) for areas of our business where we have identified increased financial crime risks.\nAnti-bribery and corruption\nWe do not tolerate any deliberate breach of anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) laws and regulations. Our Financial Crime Policy, ABC-related standards, procedures and training are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws in countries in which we operate. The ABC-related standards focus on five key risk areas, namely: employment and work opportunity; expenditure; introducers; third parties and strategic transactions.\nAnti-money laundering\nMoney laundering and terrorist financing have been identified as major threats to Barclays and the international financial services community. Barclays Financial Crime Policy and the four associated Anti-money laundering (AML) Standards are designed to ensure that all Barclays businesses and legal entities comply with the requirements and obligations set out in UK, EU and local legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance for the financial services sector, including the need to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate financial crime. Barclays AML Standards focus on four key risk areas: customer life cycle; correspondent relationships; politically exposed persons; and wire transfers.Barclays recognises that economic crimes have an adverse effect on individuals and communities wherever they occur. Endemic economic crime (particularly when associated with organised crime and terrorist financing) can threaten laws, democratic processes and basic human freedoms, impoverishing states and distorting free trade and competition. \nBarclays is committed to conducting \nits global activities with integrity and respecting its regulatory, ethical and social responsibilities to:\n■■Protect customers, employees, and others with whom we do business; and \n■■Support governments, regulators, and law enforcement in wider economic crime prevention.\nWe do not tolerate any deliberate breach of financial crime laws and regulations (e.g. bribery, corruption, and money laundering, sanctions, or tax evasion facilitation) that apply to our business and the transactions we undertake.\nEleven Group-wide Financial Crime Standards \nand associated risk-based systems and controls support the Financial Crime Policy, which is:\n■■Designed to ensure that all Barclays employees, businesses and legal entities comply with all UK, extra-territorial and locally applicable legal and regulatory obligations; \n■■Supported by the Barclays Board of Directors and applicable to all Barclays’ legal entities and business dealings globally;\n■■Approved by the Global Head of Compliance (member of the Executive Committee); \n■■Regularly reviewed for content and effectiveness, which provides senior executive management oversight committees and the Board Audit Committee with the necessary assurance regarding the operating effectiveness of the Barclays Financial Crime control framework.\nWe do not tolerate any \ndeliberate breach \nof financial crime laws \nand regulations that \napply to our business \nand the transactions \nwe undertake.\n76 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nWhistleblowing cases opened \nby category\nRetaliationBreach of controls,\nprocess, other\n37118\n34 Targets/Incentives\nTheft/FraudBreach of policy\n1424\n11 Bribery/Corruption\n16 Other\nCases opened 2019: 254The whistleblowing team is a Group function. \nThe Chair of the Board Audit Committee has been appointed by the Board to have oversight of the independence, autonomy and effectiveness of Barclays’ whistleblowing programme across the Group as a whole.\nIn addition, there is a regulatory requirement \nto appoint a non-executive director of each of the two main UK banking subsidiaries to oversee the whistleblowing arrangements in their respective entities.It is important that Barclays maintains a culture where anyone feels they can speak up if they see our high standards are not being met. Barclays is pleased that a significant majority of our employees feel it is safe to do so. Most employees feel comfortable raising concerns through the usual escalation channels; their line management, as well as Compliance, Legal and HR contacts. \nSometimes employees will not know where \nto go to speak up in confidence. To help them, Barclays has a dedicated team, called Raising Concerns that employees can contact to report their concerns in complete confidence and safe in the knowledge that the reports will be taken seriously and appropriate action taken. Whistleblowing is a core element of raising concerns at Barclays. Whistleblowing relates to concerns which fall within the wider public interest, such as a breach of our policies and procedures, breaches of law and regulation and behaviour that is likely to harm the reputation or financial well being of the Bank. We take all whistleblowing reports extremely seriously and we have zero tolerance of any retaliation against someone \nwho is a whistleblower.\nThe Raising Concerns team directs concerns \nraised to the most appropriate team to investigate; this may include, for example, Human Resources (who might deal with accusations of bullying or harassment) or Compliance (for routine matters). Whistleblowing reports will be directed to a dedicated, confidential and independent whistleblowing team to investigate.\nIn 2019, the whistleblowing team opened a \ntotal of 254 whistleblowing investigations (364 were opened in 2018), with the majority of the investigations focused on allegations of breaches of controls or processes. Of the 217 whistleblowing investigations closed in 2019, 28% were found to have some level of substantiation.\nIt is important that \nBarclays maintains a \nculture where anyone \nfeels they can speak up \nif they see our high \nstandards are not \nbeing met.Whistleblowing cases closed by region\nCases closed 2019: 21 7\nEME\n159\nAPAC\n43\nAmer\n15RUNNING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\nWhistleblowing\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 77\nManaging data privacy,  \nsecurity and resilience\nData security\nIn 2019, we introduced new policies, \ntechnology and training to ensure that all data created or managed by Barclays carries a clear security classification. This has enabled us to deploy additional controls to keep our data safe, including to stop it leaving the organisation without authorisation.\nAll newly created sensitive data is encrypted \nat source to ensure the right protection is applied through its entire life cycle, whether moving between colleagues, technologies or outside the bank. By year end we will have the technology to generate continuous monitoring of the Banks’ sensitive data enhancing this visibility in 2020.\nWhen data does leave Barclays, we work closely \nwith counterparties and vendors to ensure that they have in place effective data management so that data which we have chosen to share is afforded the appropriate protections.\nNext year we will go further and extend the \nprotections we have developed to more of our information, and deploy state-of-the-art technology to constantly scan and interrogate our information stores and data flows to identify security risks and trigger additional safeguards.\nData resilience\nThe Barclays Chief Security Office (CSO) have a set of preventative Key Controls that mitigate cyber-related risks. These focus on understanding internal and external threats and delivering our capability to counteract them. One cyber risk on which the firm is focused is Large Scale Data Corruption. Major risk events have been experienced in the industry and Barclays has responded to protect against those threats. As threats evolve we adjust our stance. Our teams use intelligence to create plausible Cyber Security Compromise Scenarios, that they deliver through real-life simulation exercises to help us focus on continuous improvement.IT resilience\nAs our organisation becomes more digital, technology plays an increasingly important role in how we deliver for our customers and clients.\nThe stability and resilience of our systems has \na direct impact on the quality of our service. We make significant investments in our infrastructure to guard against risk ranging from large scale data corruption, to hacking and third-party failure.\nOur multi-channel approach to delivering for \nour customers provides a level of resilience, and we maintain and regularly test comprehensive recovery plans to be used in the event of a failure.\nWe regret any instances of service disruption \nto customers and remain focused on reducing the volume of operational incidents. Operational incidents caused by technology are becoming less frequent across Barclays year-on-year, with a 43 per cent reduction versus last year.\nResilience and security is set as a priority from \nthe Barclays Board and seen as a responsibility of everyone within Barclays. In 2019 we ran a series of campaigns using training, videos, emails and roadshows to continue to embed a security mindset.\nBarclays recognises the importance of third \nparties in ensuring the uninterrupted provision of services to Barclays customers. We operate a class-leading third-party resilience programme which determines how critical a service is, the impact of its loss, and the methods for recovery. Frequent testing helps us to refine these response and recovery mechanisms. We conduct regular assurance activities on third-parties to assess the quality of the resilience programme.Data privacy\nWe know how important our customers’ and clients’ data is to them, and we have robust policies that govern how we manage it. We also ensure employees only have ‘need to know’ access to personal data, and ensure strict controls on third-party suppliers’ access to our data.\nA Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) oversees \nour compliance with the GDPR, and reports annually to the highest level of Barclays management on privacy issues and wider data protection risks. Customers and the public may raise complaints and raise concerns with the Group DPO via a centralised DPO mailbox.\nAll Barclays businesses and functions are \nrequired to comply with our Group-wide Privacy Policy and Global Privacy Standard. These reflect data protection and privacy laws globally, and are reviewed annually and updated as necessary. During 2019, a new mandatory privacy training module focusing on principles and behaviours, was developed and completed by all employees globally. Additional tailored training is provided to meet specific needs if required.\nResilience and security \nis set as a priority from \nthe Barclays Board and \nseen as a responsibility \nof everyone within \nBarclays.\n78 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nContributions, associations \nand memberships\nTrade associations \nBarclays is a member of several trade \nassociations globally.

We do engage with Government on issues relevant to our business and ensure that any communication undertaken is honest, comprehensive and accurate. Barclays does not give any money for political purposes in the UK, the rest of the EU or outside of the EU, nor does it make any political donations to political parties or other political organisations, or to any independent election candidates, or incur any political expenditure.\nIn accordance with the US Federal Election \nCampaign Act, Barclays provides administrative support to a federal Political Action Committee (PAC) in the USA funded by the voluntary political contributions of eligible Barclays’ employees. The PAC is not controlled by Barclays and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering committee comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC. Barclays complies with applicable laws and requirements in relation to the disclosure and publication of lobbying expenditure. We also comply with lobbying disclosure requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which they are applicable. \n Barclays’ lobbying expenditure in the \nEU and US can be accessed on the EU Transparency Register at: ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/\npublic/consultation/displaylobbyist.\ndo, and the US Lobbying Disclosure Act Database at: soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfmRUNNING A RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 79\nTax\nTax contribution and approach to tax\nWe continue to make substantial tax \npayments across the jurisdictions in which we operate, both in terms of taxes paid and taxes collected.\nIn 2019, PwC conducted their most recent \nTotal Tax Contribution survey of The One Hundred Group (100 Group) which represents members of the FTSE 100 along with several large UK private companies. This survey ranked Barclays as the fourth largest UK taxpayer, in terms of taxes paid. We have been ranked as one of the top four largest UK taxpayers in each of the last six years.\nOur approach to tax is rooted in our overall \nPurpose and Values and has three core objectives:\n1) Responsible approach to tax\nWe manage our tax affairs in accordance with our tax principles and tax code of conduct. We aim to ensure that our tax returns are filed on time and the correct amount of tax is paid.\n2) Effective interaction with tax authorities\nWe aim to have constructive and professional relationships with tax authorities. We actively support and work with tax authorities to combat tax evasion.\n3) Transparency in relation to our tax affairs\nWe are committed to being a leader in tax transparency by choosing to expand external publications such as the Country Snapshot and making clear disclosures to tax authorities.\nWe believe that it is important for our \ninvestors, customers and clients, regulators, tax authorities and other stakeholders to understand our tax contribution in the countries in which we operate and our approach to tax.\n More information can be found in our \n2019 Country Snapshot Report, which contains an overview of our tax \ncontribution country by country as \nwell as our broader approach to tax including our UK tax strategy.Value generated: revenues  \n(total income)\n£m\n20182019\n21,13621,632\n21,076 2017\nDividends paid to shareholders\n£m\n20182019\n7681,201\n509 2017\nGovernment: taxes paid globally\n£m\n20182019\n2,1751,797\n2,516 2017\nGovernment: taxes collected globally\n£m\n20182019\n2,5812,748\n2,786 2017\nEmployees: Group compensation costs\n£m\n20182019\n7,3467,343\n7,123 2017Taxes paid globally (£1,797m)\n£m\n2019218\n598658\n22895\n Irrecoverable VAT\n  Employer payroll taxes \n  Corporation tax* and \nwithholding taxes  UK bank levy \n Other taxes \n*In 2019, we received a large refund of overpaid \ncorporation tax in the US which exceeded the total \ncorporation tax paid in other jurisdictions.\nTaxes collected globally (£2,748m)\n£m\n2019128\n2432,188 9891\n Employee taxes\n Tax on share dealing\n Net VAT collected  Tax deducted at source on interest\n Other taxes \nWe have been ranked \nas one of the top four \nlargest UK taxpayers \nin each of the last \nsix years.\n80 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\n\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 81\nOur people  \nand culture\nOur people 82\nEngaging with our colleagues 83\nCulture 86Managing \nenvironmental \nand social \nimpacts\nRunning a \nresponsible \nbusinessOur people \nand cultureInvesting in \nour communitiesMaking growth \n‘green’, sustainable \nand inclusive\n82 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nOur peopleOUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE\nFemales at Managing Director \nand Director level\n%\n25 \n2019\n24 201828% target by 2021\nFemales on Board of Directors\n%\n33 \n2019\n27 201833% target by 2020\nFemales on Group ExCo and ExCo direct reports (Senior Managers)\n%\n26 2019\n28 201833% target by 2020\nFemales in Barclays\n%\n5446\n2019\n Female   Male\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, Barclays is required to \nreport on the gender breakdown of our employees and \n‘senior managers’. Our global workforce was 87,369 \n(47,392 male, 39,970 female, 7 unavailable), with 107 senior managers (79 male, 28 female). This is on a \nheadcount basis, including colleagues on long-term \nleave. Unavailable refers to colleagues who do not record \ngender in our systems. ‘Senior Managers’ represents \nthe Group Executive Committee and their direct reports.Our people make a critical difference to our \nsuccess, and our investment in them protects and strengthens our culture. \nWe increasingly draw on the latest thinking \nfrom behavioural science and data science to identify what’s most likely to be effective in hiring, developing and engaging our people, and then track effectiveness over time. We’re also starting to use the same data-driven approach to give us a much more accurate picture of how people progress through our organisation.\nHiring the best people\nWe continue to focus on hiring people with the skills that will help us accelerate the digital transformation of our organisation, as well as adapt more quickly to the changing needs of our customers and clients. \nWe have increased hiring across our core \nstrategic locations globally. Building a modern, scale presence in a smaller number of sites enables us to make significant investments in the workplace that would not otherwise be possible. The transition to having more of our people work from these strategic sites means change for our existing colleagues. We recognise the disruption that this can create and we are managing the impacts thoughtfully.\nWithin BX, we continue to rebalance the mix \nof contractors and permanent colleagues, so that more people work directly for us. We believe this is a competitive advantage and further strengthens our culture.We want to hire from within and are increasingly using data and analytics to identify and support high performers and potential future leaders – particularly from those groups that are currently under-represented amongst our senior colleagues. 34% of our vacancies were filled by internal candidates during 2019.\nJust under 900 graduates joined us in 2019, \nenabling us to develop our pipeline of future leaders in-house. The percentage of graduate female hires was 34%. We also provided over 300 people with the opportunity to complete a structured apprenticeship. \nWe have continued to put additional effort \ninto supporting people who have been in the armed forces to find a career at Barclays, through the ‘After’ programme. We have also supported those returning to the workforce after a career break, through our ‘Encore’ programme.\nPeople with different perspectives and life \nexperiences make our organisation stronger. We are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and inclusive workforce, and providing equal opportunities.\nWe aim to make sure our hiring is as diverse \nas possible. Our policies require us to give full and fair consideration to all populations based on their aptitudes and abilities. We’re using data and analytics to better understand how we can improve our hiring process. \nWe recognise the importance of measuring \nprogress around our gender diversity agenda and believe that setting targets is an effective way to do this. We’ve set ourselves a target of 28% female Managing Directors and Directors by the end of 2021, and have signed up to the Hampton Alexander targets of 33% female representation on each of our Boards and across our Group Executive Committee (ExCo) and their direct reports by the end of 2020. We continue to report on our results as part of the Hampton Alexander Review and HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter. We believe that the culture of Barclays is built and shaped by the thousands of professionals around the world who serve our customers and clients with a shared Purpose and Values.\nPeople with different \nperspectives and life \nexperiences make our \norganisation stronger.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 83\nDeveloping talent for the future\nWe operate in a highly-regulated environment, \nso it’s critical to our success that our people understand the rules that govern how we operate. We invested £36m in training last year to ensure we get this right.\nA wide range of development opportunities \nare available to help all our people build their career, delivered both in-person and through our new digital learning platform, Learning Lab, which is making development more available than ever.\nWe also launched two new flagship leadership \ndevelopment programmes during 2019. This is a significant investment in our future leaders, driven by our core belief that quality leadership makes a difference to our success. We track the progression of people that have participated in these programmes to see how effective they are. \nWe remain committed to closing pay gaps at \nBarclays; the difference in seniority between male and female colleagues, and between BAME and non-BAME colleagues. \n For more information see our Pay Gaps \nReport at: barclays.com\nColleague engagement\nWe have an established approach to engaging \ncolleagues which includes the majority of the UK’s Financial Reporting Council (FRC) recommendations, and is in line with new governance requirements in 2019. This ensures that we understand their perspective, take it into account in our decision making at the most senior level, and share with them our strategy and progress.\nThat extends to those who work for us \nindirectly as well, such as contractors, although in a more limited way. In 2020, our supplier code of conduct will require organisations with more than 250 employees to demonstrate that they have an effective workforce engagement approach of their own.\nIt’s important to us that our Board members \nare engaged with our people – directly, and indirectly through our management team. \nWe regularly report on our colleague \nengagement activity to our Boards. \nTogether with direct engagement, this \ncomprehensive reporting approach and dedicated time at board meetings helps our Board take the issues of interest to our colleagues into account in their decision making.\nThis has enabled them to confirm that our \nworkforce engagement approach is effective.

The collective bargaining coverage of Unite in the UK represents c.52% of our global workforce.\nWhen we make significant changes to our \nbusiness, they can affect our people and can mean that redundancies are necessary. We consult in detail with colleague representatives on major change programmes affecting our people. We do this to help us minimise compulsory job losses wherever possible, including through voluntary redundancy and redeployment.\nOur people policies\nAnother way we shape the culture of our organisation is through our people policies, which are reviewed regularly, including by our Board.\nOur policies are designed to provide equal \nopportunities and create an inclusive culture, in line with our values and in support of our long-term success. They also reflect relevant employment law, including the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\nWe expect our people to treat each other \nwith dignity and respect, and do not tolerate discrimination, bullying, harassment or victimisation.\nWe are committed to paying our people fairly \nand equitably relative to their role, skills, experience and performance – in a way that balances the needs of all our stakeholders. That means our remuneration policies reward sustainable performance that’s in line with our Purpose and Values, as well as our risk expectations.\n You can find more information in our \nFair Pay Report, available on barclays.com\nWe encourage our people to benefit from \nBarclays’ performance by enrolling in our share plans, further strengthening their commitment to the organisation.\nThe Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 85 to 123 of the Barclays PLC Annual Report 2019 sets out updates on remuneration outcomes and developments during 2019. It also explains our plans for 2020, including our proposed new Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which will be subject to a vote at the next AGM.Facts and figures\nEmployee survey results\n“I would recommend Barclays  \nas a good place to work.”\n20182019\n8380\nColleague engagement\n%\n20182019\n7977\n78 2017\nThis is a measure derived from the nine engagement \nquestions in our Your View employee survey.\n893\nGraduate hires\n311\nApprenticeships\n10%\nVoluntary employee turnover\n15%\nEmployee turnover\n15\nAverage training hours per annum \nper employee (payroll)Listening to our people\nOur regular colleague survey formally \ncaptures the views of all our people and is a key part of how we track colleague engagement. Our overall engagement score reduced slightly to 77% in 2019, but 80% of our colleagues would still recommend Barclays as a good place to work. Our colleagues also shared that 79% of them feel it’s safe to speak up to share their views. \n89% of colleagues told us they believe \nBarclays is focused on achieving good customer and client outcomes and 86% said they are proud of the contribution Barclays makes to the community and society. \nOnly 61% of our people said the stress levels \nat work are manageable, and 53% believe that we have been successful in eliminating obstacles to efficiency. Improving these scores is a key priority and we are working on the underlying problems.\nThe results from the survey are an important \npart of the conversations our leaders have about how we run the business, and it’s a specific focus for our Executive Committee and our Board. The Executive Committee holds a dedicated town hall for colleagues each year, specifically to talk about their feedback and the actions we’re taking in response, and there are many follow up communications and action plans built across the Group.\nWe monitor our culture across the \norganisation, and in individual business areas, through culture dashboards. These combine colleague survey data with other metrics about our business, so that we can see the effect our people’s engagement has on our performance, and on the continued strength of our culture. 82% of our people have heard or read senior leaders talking about the character and culture of Barclays.\nKeeping our people informed\nIn addition to these data sources, our leaders, including our Board, engage face-to-face with colleagues locally to hear what they think. That might be through site visits, large-scale town halls, training and development activity, mentoring, informal breakfast sessions, committee membership, diversity and well-being programmes, or focus and consultative groups.\nWe make sure we’re regularly keeping everyone up to date on the strategy, performance and progress of the organisation through a strategically-coordinated, multi-channel approach across a combination of leader-led engagement, and digital and print communication, including blogs, vlogs and podcasts. \nWe also engage with our people collectively \nthrough a strong and effective partnership with Unite, as well as the Barclays Group European Forum, which represents all colleagues within the European Union. \nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 85\nEmployees\nSplit by level\n%\n2019 54\n557 39\n7 38 2018\n  Senior (Managing Director and Director) \n   Middle (Assistant Vice President and \nVice President)\n  Junior (Business Analyst grades)\nEmployees by employment type\n%\n496\n2019\n  Payroll   Agency\nSplit by payroll/non-payroll \nin Technology\n%\n2674\n2019\n  Payroll  Non-payroll\nPayroll: refers to colleagues employed directly by \nBarclays, on Barclays payroll and on a Barclays contract\nAgency: refers to temporary staff paid through \na third party for a defined term\nNon-Payroll: refers to agency and staff employed via \na third party contracted by Barclays to perform a service\nThe majority of Agency workers in Barclays are based \nwithin the UK and India and are part of our PPI operation \nto manage and close legacy complaints.Part-time  \ncolleagues\n%\n2019 89 11\n  Full-time   Part-time  \nPart-time colleagues gender split\n%\n2019 93 7\n  Female   Male \nFull time colleagues gender split\n%\n2019 40 60\n  Female   Male \nAge of employees\n%\n22.5\n13.0\n201938.1\n22.0\n12.4\n201837.622.6 24.4\n2.2\n0.82.5\n0.80.6 0.5\n <20\n >=20 & <30 \n >=30 & <40\n >=40 & <50\n >=50 & <60 \n >60 years\n UnavailableEmployment type split by region\nPayroll\n20,400\n9,800\n2,80047,800\n2019\n  UK\n   Europe Americas\n Asia Pacific\nAgency\n1,2001,900\n2019\n00\n  UK\n   Europe Americas\n Asia Pacific\n86 Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 home.barclays/annualreport\nOur peopleOUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE\nThrough our BeWell programme, we provide \nexpert advice and guidance on the practical steps colleagues can take to look after their physical and mental health. In 2020, our Mental Health Awareness training will become mandatory for all colleagues. We were one of the first businesses to sign up to the Mental Health at Work Commitment. 74% of colleagues say that Barclays supports employee efforts to enhance their well-being.\nThe tools to succeed\nWe provide tools, programmes and support that enable colleagues to balance their work-life with their personal commitments, supporting career development opportunities at each life stage.\nWe offer enhanced maternity, paternity, \nadoption and shared parental entitlements.\nWe’re continuing to shape a more agile, \ntechnology-led culture through dynamic working, so that we can meet our people’s desire to work more flexibly. 88% of colleagues say they are able to work dynamically and this is one of the biggest drivers for overall engagement, with more favourable scores across all questions. \nHowever, our people also told us that we need \nto invest more in the technology and services we use internally. Only 56% of people said they have the work tools and resources they need to achieve excellent performance and this is a reduction year over year. We’ve made significant progress particularly in our new strategic campus sites, but we need to get the balance right between required investment and cost discipline in order to effectively balance the needs of all of our stakeholder groups.\nWe’re replacing the old devices that we know \nour people can find frustrating, and we’re updating our software and connectivity so that getting work done is easier. We’ve also invested in the technology support we provide to our people, so that when things do go wrong, we can put them right more quickly. Building a supportive culture\nDiversity of thought and experience works best when everyone feels included. People who feel they can be themselves at work are happier and more productive, so we believe that creating an inclusive and diverse culture isn’t just the right thing to do, but is also best for our business.\nWe focus on five areas: disability, gender, \nLGBT+, multicultural, and multigenerational. Each of these is represented and championed by a senior leader, and embedded deeply into the organisation through colleague networks organised by our people and funded by Barclays. \nOur networks provide colleagues with \nvaluable support and advice, create development opportunities, and raise awareness of issues and challenges. Our networks also influence our people policies, teaching us how we need to adapt to give our people the support they need to succeed. 85% of our colleagues say that they feel included within their teams.\nOur policies require managers to give full and \nfair consideration to those with a disability on the basis of their aptitudes and abilities; both when hiring and through ongoing people management, as well as ensuring opportunities for training, career development and promotion are available to all. As part of the UK government Disability Confident scheme, we encourage applications from people with a disability, or a physical or mental health condition.\nWe encourage everyone working at Barclays, \nor thinking about joining us, to tell us what support and adjustments they need to be their best at work. We’re working hard to make the processes that support this more effective, recognising that at times getting the support colleagues need can be slow. \nWe track the ever-changing composition of \nour people through online dashboards, to make sure that our senior leaders understand the diverse makeup and needs of the organisation they lead. We’re also an inaugural signatory of the UK’s Race at Work Charter. \n74% of colleagues say \nthat Barclays supports \nemployee efforts to \nenhance their well-\nbeing. Over the next few years, our focus will be on \nenabling much greater collaboration, right across the organisation, so that we can unlock the power of the connections between our people.\n See our 2019 dynamic working report: \nhome.barclays/content/dam/home-barclays/documents/who-we-are/our-strategy/\nDandI/2019-Digital-DW-Report-\nlandscape.pdf\nMore information is available at: home.barclays/who-we-are/our-strategy/diversity-and-inclusion/multigenera-tional/dynamic-working\nTraining and development\nAt Barclays, we believe it’s important to foster \nan environment which supports our people to continuously grow and develop. We are committed to investing in our people at all stages of their career to help them develop both in their existing role and future career, and our strategy is to provide colleagues with a balance of formal and informal learning and great on-the-job development experiences. Our goals are to develop the skills which will help us accelerate the digital transformation of our organisation and adapt to the changing needs of our customers and clients, whilst helping our people build their careers.\nWe have a wide variety of development \nprogrammes and training available. We have developed a new digital learning platform called Learning Lab which is the gateway for colleagues at all levels to access learning and development to support them in the jobs they do today and help them prepare for future opportunities. This learning, available in a variety of forms, aims to develop their technical job specific skills, personal skills, and leadership skills. This is in addition to locally led, line manager owned activities. We have a number of corporate memberships with industry experts, allowing our colleagues to remain up to date with the latest developments and trends. In line with our global study policy, Barclays also encourages colleagues to study for degree programmes and professional qualifications that benefit the \nbusiness and support their development.\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 87\nWe measure the success of our development \noffering through our employee engagement survey, tracking the progression of participants from our leadership development programmes, and tracking our levels of retention, and internal mobility. These measures feed into our training and development approach, enabling us to focus action on the right areas for our workforce.\nBenefits\nBarclays provides a comprehensive rewards package to employees, comprising a competitive salary, and discretionary annual bonus, further complemented with benefits such as pension, private healthcare, life assurance, holiday entitlement, and many other options to support colleagues at work and in their home life. We also provide opportunity for our colleagues to benefit from Barclays share price performance by enrolling in our all-employee share plans.\n For more detail on our employee \nbenefits visit: home.barclays/careers/working-at-barclays\nParental leave\nWe are committed to ensuring that Barclays is \nan inclusive workplace, where everyone feels supported, valued and respected. As part of this commitment, we offer support for families, parents and carers to help enable our colleagues to balance their professional and personal lives. Our policies are considered in line with local practices and statutory requirements, and in many locations Barclays offers enhanced maternity, adoption, paternity and shared parental support which exceed statutory requirements.

The programme has already helped over 10 million people since 2013 and is committed to helping a further 6 million people by 2022. Independent evaluation shows evidence that young people are using what they have learnt through LifeSkills to secure employment and manage their finances more effectively.\nThroughout 2019 LifeSkills continued to build \non its support for young people:\n■■Created innovative new lessons to ensure young people have the tools needed as economic, societal and technological advances drive the pace of change in the workplace.

Taking learnings from previous pilots, in 2019 LifeSkills supported young people in Bury and Kilmarnock with an intensive programme designed to their local needs. \nBuilding on the extensive knowledge and experience gained in running LifeSkills the programme was extended to the whole of the UK workforce and across all ages in 2019. The programme aims to help all people in the UK workforce, whether that’s a young person developing skills and preparing for their first job, to someone wanting to progress in their career, make changes to their working life, introduce more flexibility and well-being or even start their own business.We believe that a strong, inclusive economy  is a better economy for everyone.LifeSkillsINVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES\nLifeSkills case study\nDavid* was in danger of being \nexcluded for disruptive behaviour when he was chosen for an intensive \nprogramme of LifeSkills workshops \nin Bury.

As a significant driver of ESG ratings performance is underpinned by disclosure, we would expect this to support our scores over time.\nWe are further engaging with our \nstakeholders, including Ratings agencies, investors and expert bodies, to improve transparency and enhance understanding of different assessment frameworks and ESG scoring models used by the various agencies.\nThere is currently some inconsistency in terms \nof what best practice looks like and how it is measured across different ratings agencies. This is reflected in the variance in methodologies, and therefore in the variance in Barclays’ ESG Rating across the different providers. There is limited consistency in the underlying data used both within and across sectors. \nWhilst this remains an unregulated area, we \nbelieve that it is important that these agencies, working with companies, investors and other market participants, continue to enhance consistency and transparency to support increasingly robust ESG data and ratings in the future.\nWe recognise that markets and stakeholders \nneed clear, relevant and consistent information and we will continue to focus on enhancing disclosures, particularly on climate change, and across wider ESG factors, including the TCFD framework.ESG ratings\nMSCI\nBarclays was rated BBB by MSCI ESG Ratings (2018:’BBB’). \nSustainalytics\nWe scored 66 points in Sustainalytics ESG Ratings (2018: 60 points) and 31.7 points in the Sustainalytics risk rating (2018: 31.2). The change in Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings was driven by the application of standard industry average scores for additional ESG factors, and does not currently reflect Barclays’ actual performance on those issues.\nRobecoSAM\nWe saw an increase in our RobecoSAM percentile score to the 77th percentile, up from 72nd in 2018. We saw a decrease in our actual score to 70, from 75 in 2018, against a sector average of 46 points.\nFTSE4Good\nOur FTSE4Good ESG Rating increased to 4.8/5 (2018: 4.3/5) with an 97th percentile ranking against the global banks sector. \nDisclosure ratings\nISS\nThe Institutional Shareholder Services’ (ISS) assigns environmental and social quality scores for corporate disclosures.

To this end, we will set and publish targets where we can have the most significant impacts.\n2.1 Impact Analysis:\n  Show that your bank has identified \nthe areas in which it has its most \nsignificant (potential) positive and negative impact through an impact analysis that fulfils the following elements: \n a)  Scope: The bank’s core business areas, products/services across the main geographies that the bank operates in as described under 1.1. have been considered in the scope of the analysis.\n b)  Scale of Exposure: In identifying \nits areas of most significant impact the bank has considered where its core business/its major activities lie in terms of industries, technologies and geographies.\n c)  Context & Relevance: Your bank \nhas taken into account the most relevant challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the countries/regions in which it operates.\n d)  Scale and intensity/salience of \nimpact: In identifying its areas of most significant impact, the bank has considered the scale and intensity/salience of the (potential) social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products and services. \n  (your bank should have engaged with relevant stakeholders to help inform your analysis under elements c) and d)) \n  Show that building on this analysis, \nthe bank has: \n■■Identified and disclosed its areas of most significant (potential) positive and negative impact\n■■Identified strategic business opportunities in relation to the increase of positive impacts/reduction of negative impactsWe continue to analyse significant potential positive and negative impacts of our business. The starting point for this analysis is an understanding of the material ESG issues for our stakeholders, including our customers and clients, our colleagues, society and investors. These have been set out on page 8 of this report. \nThis analysis takes into consideration the bank’s business model, the scope \nand scale of the bank’s services (section 1.1. and page 7), the income by geography, which highlights 95% of Group income being originated in the UK, EU and Americas (page 7), the sector credit exposure as illustrated in our Pillar 3 Report (page 90), and our underwriting activities as set out in the Climate-related financial disclosures of this report (pages 41 to 65).\nUnderstanding and responding to potential negative impacts\nBased on the nature of our business, we are focusing our analysis on the \nfollowing focus areas:\n■■social and environmental impacts of financing including climate change; and\n■■the accessibility and transparency of our financial products.\nBarclays has undertaken a pilot study using the 2 Degree Investing Initiative PACTA methodology (page 49). While the primary focus of the tool is not quantifying climate impact in absolute terms, it offers a means of assessing our lending portfolios alignment with a 2 degree scenario, and therefore, a means to reviewing potential negative impact on our climate.\nOur TCFD disclosure contains a breakdown of high carbon sector exposure \nof the bank (pages 62-63) in addition to our analysis of our underwriting \nactivity by sector (page 64). This analysis provides a basis for the \ncontinued improvement of our environmental and social risk management activities as set out on pages 34-37 and 53-55.\nIn 2019, we reviewed and published a report on our exposure to clients \ninvolved in “soft commodities” including timber, palm oil and soy to identify relationships giving rise to potential negative impacts resulting from deforestation. Across these commodities, universally recognised certification schemes including RSPO, FSC & PEFC, and RTRS, provide a means of promoting environmental best practice and minimising potential negative impacts. The report covers all clients operating in high deforestation risk markets and provides a breakdown of those clients covered by applicable certifications and those that are not covered, thereby identifying relationships which expose Barclays to elevated risks of negative impacts linked to deforestation. For full details refer to our Barclays soft commodities impact progress report.\nBarclays also recognises that we have a responsibility to monitor and \nuphold human rights where they have the potential to be impacted by our direct operations, as well as our financing and purchasing practices. To better understand and address this, we are currently working with an expert human rights advisory organisation to assist us in identifying our most salient human rights risks and impacts, and enhance our approach to managing these.\nWe are committed to ensuring our financial services are accessible, \ntransparent and responsible. Details are set out on pages 29-30, including but not limited to, our approach to product design and financial well-being.Barclays PLC 2019 ESG Report\nESG and our \nbusiness\nPage 8\nIncome by \ngeography\nPage 7\nBarclays PLC 2019 \nGRI Index: home.barclays/esg2019\nBarclays PLC 2019 \nAnnual Report suite\nhome.barclays/\ninvestor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports\nincluding\nBarclays PLC Pillar 3 \nReport 2019\nIndustry credit \nexposures \nPages 62-63\nBarclays PLC 2019 \nStrategic Report \nNon financial \ninformation statement \nPages 43-44\nSoft commodities \ncompact progress report: home.barclays/esg2019Principles for Responsible \nBanking reportingADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 99\nReporting and  \nSelf-Assessment Requirements High-level summary of bank’s response  (limited assurance required for responses to highlighted items) Reference(s)/Link(s) to bank’s  full response/relevant information\nPlease provide your bank’s conclusion/statement if it has fulfilled the requirements regarding Impact Analysis.\nWe continue to make progress in assessing our significant positive and negative impacts and we are focused on ensuring this \nassessment covers all our core business activities as a financial institution.

We continue to collaborate with UNEPFI, peers and other organisations to explore and implement best practices which support the implementation of the principles.\nAnnex: Definitions\n a.  Impact: An impact is commonly understood as being a change in outcome for a stakeholder. In the context of these Principles this means (aligned with GRI definition) the effect a bank has on people/the society, the economy and the environment and with that on sustainable development. Impacts may be positive or negative, direct or indirect, actual or potential, intended or unintended, short term or long term.\n b.  Significant Impact: Impact that in terms of scale and/or intensity/salience results in a particularly strong/relevant change in outcome for a stakeholder. In the context of these Principles, the concept of significant impact is used to ensure banks focus where their actions/business (can) matter most for people, economy and environment and to provide a reasonable and practical threshold for what issues \nneed to be considered/included, similar to the concept of ‘materiality’.ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES\nPrinciples for Responsible \nBanking reporting\nhome.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 103\nSustainability Accounting \nStandards Board (SASB)\nBarclays is reporting against the SASB disclosure framework for the first time in 2019, noting its growing importance amongst our investor base. In \naddition, we believe the financial-materiality focus of the indicators is of importance to all our stakeholders.\nThe table below details our disclosures against the SASB standards and indicators. The relevant standards have been selected on a materiality-driven \nbasis, and the individual indicators are outlined where in the report the relevant information can be found, and any supplementary information.\nGoing forward, we anticipate to enhance the breadth and depth of our reporting against the SASB framework, to include reporting against additional \nindicators. This report represents a best efforts basis including the information and data available for 2019, with more planned in subsequent editions.\nNoting that SASB is a global framework with, at present, a US-focused approach to defining criteria, we have noted where we translate the spirit \nand meaning of the indicator to meet our UK reporting methods. We intend to work with SASB going forward to understand the best way to standardise disclosure for different reporting regions.\nGroup\nThe following disclosures are taken from individual Standards and disclosed at a Group level to reflect the business-wide approach.\nTopic Accounting Metric Code\nTransparent \nInformation \n& Fair \nAdvice for CustomersDescription of \napproach to informing customers about products and servicesFN-AC-270a.3\nSee page 74 of this report for details of our approach to responsible lending and communicating \nwith customers.\nSee pages 68-73 for details of our approach to conduct, including our Code of Conduct - The \nBarclays Way.\nSee pages 29-30 for accessible retail products and services.\nSupplementary information\nBarclays UK – Retail\nBarclays’ strategy reflects our commitment to treating our customers fairly. We have a pivotal role to play in society, building relationships where we understand our customers and clients’ aspirations and developing the products and services that meet their needs, thereby making a difference to their finances and lives. \nWe carefully consider the requirements of all our stakeholders during the development of products \nand services. This includes a commitment to accessibility and inclusion, giving customers the ability to take control of their finances in a manner convenient to them and the promotion of financial capability. Furthermore, within Barclays UK, we have a Performance Management Framework in place, created and owned by customer facing teams, that provides guidance on how to measure, manage, reward and recognise our colleagues. This in turn equips them with the tools to provide the right customer experiences and outcomes as they are better able to: \n■■Support the right customer outcomes through their channel of choice;\n■■Be informed by the BUK purpose and strategy;\n■■Support a performance culture promoting sustainable growth;\n■■Encourage collaboration across BUK; and \n■■Be empowered to take accountability for the decisions they make in delivering the right outcomes.\nAccessibility and inclusionBarclays aims to be the most accessible and inclusive FTSE100 firm. We work on the basis that there should be equality of service for all and customers should not face a barrier regardless of channel, for instance all our websites and apps should be fully accessible. We aim for our \ncustomers to have a consistent and accessible experience regardless of the products they have or \nthe channels they use.\nIn the retail bank, we continually monitor and evolve through monitoring customer experience, \nincluding complaints, and a dedicated team targets solutions for any issues that we identify. We further partner on research with specialist organisations, for example we regularly conduct customer and consumer research to better understand the experience of our customers and areas for development. \nWe follow emerging Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance on customer vulnerability and we \nare working closely with the FCA to meet best practice guidance. During 2019 we responded to a recent open consultation on their updated guidance in this space.

The level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to a bank’s systemic importance and can range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer must be met with CET1. In November 2019, the FSB published an update to its list of G-SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer that applies to the Barclays Group.\nSee pages 205-206 of the Barclays PLC 2019 Annual Report for more information on \nthe prudential requirements of Barclays G-SIB score.\nNote on methodology\nThis indicator was taken from the SASB Standard for Commercial Banks and \nInvestment Banking & Brokerage.

Those terms permit disclosure to other parties, solely for the purpose of Barclays showing that it has obtained an independent assurance report in connection with the Selected Information. \nWe have not considered the interest of any \nother party in the Selected Information.

Our conclusion \nBased on the work we have performed and the \nevidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Selected Information has not been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. \nThis conclusion is to be read in the context of \nthe remainder of this report, in particular the inherent limitations explained below and this report’s intended use. \nSelected In formation \nThe scope of our work includes only the information included within the Barclays PLC Environmental Social Governance Report 2019 (‘the Report’) for the year ended 31 December \n2019 marked with the symbol\n r (‘the Selected \nInformation’). \nWe have not performed any work, and do not \nexpress any conclusion, over any other information \nthat may be included in the Report or displayed \non Barclays’ website for the current year or for previous periods unless otherwise indicated. \nReporting Criteria \nThe Reporting Criteria we used to form our judgements are the ‘Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) – 2019 Reporting Framework’ as set out at http://home.barclays/esg2019 (‘the Reporting Criteria’). The Selected Information needs to be read together with the Reporting Criteria. \nInhe rent limitations \nThe nature of non-financial information; the absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw; and the methods and precision used to determine non-financial information, allow for different, but acceptable evaluation and measurement techniques and can result in materially different measurements, affecting comparability between entities and over time. \nDirectors’ responsibilities \nThe Directors of Barclays are responsible for: \n■■designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Selected Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; \n■■selecting and/or developing objective Reporting Criteria; \n■■measuring and reporting the Selected Information in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; \n■■the contents and statements contained within the Report and the Reporting Criteria; and \n■■the maintenance and integrity of the Report \nas it appears on Barclays’ website.Our r esponsibilities \nOur responsibility is to plan and perform our \nwork to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria and to report to Barclays in the form of an independent limited assurance conclusion based on the work performed and the evidence obtained. \nAssurance st andard s applied \nWe performed our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 – ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ (‘ISAE 3000’) and in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 – ‘Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ (‘ISAE 3410’), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. \nThe work performed in a limited assurance \nengagement varies in nature and timing from, and is less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. \nIndependence, professional standards and \nquality \ncontrol \nWe comply with the Code of Ethics for \nProfessional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants and we apply International Standard on Quality Control (UK) 1, ‘Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements’.

Reported numbers reflect best estimates and judgements at the given point in time. Consistent with its usual practice, Barclays expects that from time to time over the coming quarter it will meet with investors globally to discuss these results and other matters relating to the Group.\nForward-looking statements\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, ‘continue’, ‘aim’, ‘anticipate’, ‘target’, ‘projected’, ‘expect’, ‘estimate’, ‘intend’, ‘plan’, ‘goal’, ‘believe’, ‘achieve’ or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by members of the management of the Group (including, without limitation, during management presentations to financial analysts) in connection with this document. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group’s future financial position, income growth, assets, impairment charges, provisions, business strategy, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, payment of dividends (including dividend payout ratios and expected payment strategies), projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets, projected costs or savings, any commitments and targets, estimates of capital expenditures, plans and objectives for future operations, projected employee numbers, IFRS impacts and other statements that are not historical fact. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. The forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made and such statements may be affected by changes in legislation, the development of standards and interpretations under IFRS, including evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of accounting and regulatory standards, the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations, future levels of conduct provisions, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, geopolitical risks and the impact of competition. In addition, factors including (but not limited to) the following may have an effect: capital, leverage and other regulatory rules applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions; the effects of any volatility in credit markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; effects of changes in valuation of credit market exposures; changes in valuation of issued securities; volatility in capital markets; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by such entities; the potential for one or more countries exiting the Eurozone; instability as a result of the exit by the UK from the European Union and the disruption that may subsequently result in the UK and globally; and the success of future acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group’s control. As a result, the Group’s actual financial position, future results, dividend payments, capital, leverage or other regulatory ratios or other financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group’s forward-looking statements. Additional risks and factors which may impact the Group’s future financial condition and performance are identified in our filings with the SEC (including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019), which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Subject to our obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction, (including, without limitation, the UK and the US), in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.      \nForward-looking statements\n\nRegistered office: 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP \n© Barclays Bank PLC 2020 9917251\nRegistered in England.

Environmental Social & Governance Report 5\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES INTRODUCTIONPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nStakeholder Engagement \nOur firm has a broad range of stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, regulators and policymakers, customers and clients, \nresearch analysts and communities. Ongoing and proactive engagement with these groups makes our company stronger and better informed. It helps us gain valuable insight into our stakeholders’ perspectives and the topics that matter to them. It better enables us to develop products, services and programs that are responsive to their needs. This engagement also allows us to share information about our firm’s strategy, practices and performance.\nResponsibility for engaging with stakeholder groups is widely shared across our firm’s lines of business and corporate functions, and we \nengage through numerous channels. For example:\nShareholders \nWe interact and communicate with shareholders through our Investor Day, quarterly earnings calls, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Annual Report and Proxy Statement, annual meeting of shareholders, investor conferences, web communications and other forums. We conduct a formal shareholder outreach program focused on topics including corporate governance, the firm's strategy and performance and matters related to the Proxy Statement. In these meetings, we solicit shareholders’ perspectives and share information about our management of a range of matters, including ESG topics. For example, the main areas of focus of our fall 2019 meetings were executive compensation, corporate governance and climate change strategy. After each of these outreach programs, we share feedback from our investors with our Board. In 2019 we reached out to our top 100 and select other shareholders, together representing over 50% of our outstanding common stock, and received feedback from shareholders representing approximately 45% of the firm’s outstanding common stock across more than 60 engagements.\nWe also engage in dialogue outside of these more formal \nchannels. These engagements provide us with useful feedback, which we consider when developing the strategic direction for the firm.Employees \nWe share information with our employees and gather their input through our global Employee Opinion Surveys, regular town hall and small group meetings, blogs and newsletters, online suggestion tools via our intranet and other forums. We also have a variety of mechanisms through which employees can fulfill their obligation to report any known or suspected violation of our Code of Conduct, company policies or laws that govern our business. This includes our toll-free Code Reporting Hotline, which is operated by an independent third party and offers translation services. Employees can contact the hotline to report concerns 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \nRegulators and Policymakers \nWe strive to maintain an open, ongoing dialogue with our global supervisory regulators and a broad array of other policymakers. Our senior leaders and Directors commit a significant amount of their time to meeting with our regulators and policymakers, providing opportunities for us to hear firsthand about their priorities and to keep them informed about developments in our businesses. In addition, our businesses and control functions engage with regulators—for example, through exams and continuous monitoring, regular meetings and ad hoc requests. We share reports with regulators on a range of matters. We also seek feedback about whether they are getting the right level, quality and frequency of information.\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES INTRODUCTIONPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

Customers may communicate with us directly in our branches, via surveys, through our website and  our various social media channels, and by phone or mail. We  also regularly engage with and solicit feedback from our  \ncorporate, institutional, public sector and other clients through multiple channels, including individual meetings, conferences and other forums.\nResearch Analysts \nWe provide a wide range of information to members of the investment community, including financial and ESG analysts and researchers, through reports, presentations, regulatory filings, conferences and publications on our website, as well as by responding to surveys and specific information requests. We also engage with analysts and researchers through calls and meetings.\nCommunities \nWithin our communities, we engage with nonprofit organizations on matters that are important to consumers and our business. For example, through the Chase Advisory Panel program, our senior executives engage with national consumer policy groups to discuss issues related to the firm’s products, policies, customer-facing practices and communications and public policy issues. In addition, through the JPMorgan Chase \nPolicy Center we develop \nand advance policies at the federal, state and local levels designed to drive inclusive economic growth and strengthen communities (see p. 24).

Environmental Social & Governance Report 7\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES INTRODUCTIONPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nPromoting Sound Governance\nOur firm has robust structures, processes and controls designed to support and promote accountability, \ntransparency and ethical behavior—and we continually evaluate and enhance them to help us operate \nto the highest standards of performance in everything we do. Equally critical, we seek to create and reinforce a strong and healthy culture in which employees feel respected and empowered to do what is right for all of our stakeholders.\nLeadership and Governance  \nOutstanding people, strong leadership and effective governance and controls are the foundation of our success. Our senior management \nteam develops the company’s strategic direction and oversees its execution, while our Board of Directors provides oversight of management’s performance. In addition, senior management and the Board are charged with demonstrating, communicating and reinforcing the company’s commitment to doing business in accordance with our corporate standards and Business Principles.\nBoard of Directors\nOur Directors are a diverse group who bring a strong combination of executive experience and skills aligned with our business and strategy. Apart from our CEO, all of our Directors are independent, under the standards established by the New York Stock Exchange and the firm’s Corporate Governance Principles. We have a Lead Independent Director who is appointed annually by the independent Directors and facilitates independent Board oversight of management. At our 2019 annual meeting, our shareholders elected to our Board 11 Directors, including two women Directors and two black Directors. In 2020, two of our Directors decided to retire when their terms expire and one new Director has been nominated for election. Of the 10 individuals nominated at our 2020 annual meeting on May 19, 2020, three are women and one is black.\nThe firm’s Corporate Governance Principles and the charters of the Board’s five principal standing committees establish a framework \nfor the governance of the Board and oversight of the firm. Among their responsibilities, the committees oversee a range of matters pertaining to ESG topics. For example:\n ~The Compensation & Management Development Committee (CMDC) reviews and approves the firm’s compensation and benefit programs and oversees the firm’s culture, which includes reviewing feedback from employees and cultural initiatives and updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and related employee actions. As part of its oversight responsibilities, the committee also reviews the relationship among risk, risk management and compensation in light of the firm’s objectives, including the avoidance of practices that would encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking.  ~The Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee provides oversight of the governance of the Board of Directors, including evaluation and recommendation of Director candidates. JPMorgan Chase seeks Director candidates who uphold the highest standards, are committed to the firm’s values and are strong, independent stewards of the long-term interests of shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which we work. In addition to considering candidates who have the combined professional skills, experience, personal qualities, balance of tenure and collegiality needed for an effective and engaged Board, the Board looks for individuals who will contribute diverse viewpoints and perspectives to enhance its independent oversight.\n ~The Risk Committee provides oversight of management’s responsibility to implement an effective global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the firm’s risks.

Environmental Social & Governance Report\n~The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of \nmanagement’s responsibilities to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the assets and income of the firm and maintain compliance with the firm’s ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. \n~The Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the firm’s positions and practices on matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices \n \nand other issues that reflec\nt the firm’s values and impact  \nits reputation. \nOur annual \nProxy Statement includes details about the membership \nand responsibilities of these committees.\nManagement \nThe design of our management structure is intended to encourage effective leadership that is consistent with our corporate standards and promotes a strong corporate culture. We manage our firm on a line-of-business basis, while also maintaining strong corporate functions and appropriate governance of our subsidiaries. Within each line of business, the management structure mirrors that of the firm as a whole. \nOur firm’s most senior management body is the Operating \nCommittee, which is responsible for developing and implementing corporate strategy and managing operations. As of December 31, 2019, women held 50% of the seats on the Operating Committee.\nExecutive Compensation \nOur firm’s compensation philosophy is designed to be responsive to and aligned with shareholders’ interests and encourages a shared success culture in support of our Business Principles and strategic framework. Our approach is driven by our recognition that the long-term success of our firm depends in large measure on the talents of our employees and alignment of their compensation with performance, business strategy and sustained shareholder value.The CMDC of the Board maintains independent oversight of our compensation programs, including executive compensation. In determining compensation for Operating Committee members, the CMDC uses a balanced and discretionary approach to assess performance against four broad dimensions over a sustained period of time: (i) Business Results; (ii) Risk, Controls & Conduct, including feedback received from the firm’s risk and control professionals; (iii) Client/Customer/Stakeholder, including our engagement in communities; and (iv) Teamwork & Leadership, including creating a diverse, inclusive and respectful environment and developing employees, managers and leaders. These performance dimensions consider short-, medium- and long-term priorities that drive sustained shareholder value, while accounting for risk, controls and conduct objectives.\nThe intent of our compensation program is to incentivize long-\nterm, sustainable decision making and to hold individuals accountable, when appropriate, for meaningful actions or issues that negatively impact business performance or the firm’s reputation. We maintain policies and procedures that enable us to take prompt and proportionate actions with respect to accountable individuals, including (i) reduction or elimination of annual incentive compensation; (ii) cancellation of unvested awards; (iii) clawback of previously paid compensation; and (iv) other employment-related actions, including termination of employment.\nWe regularly review our compensation program and actively seek \nout and consider feedback in making potential changes. In 2019, 72% of our shareholders voted in favor of our annual advisory resolution to approve executive compensation. In response to shareholder feedback, the CMDC made enhancements to certain features of the long-term equity awards made to the Operating Committee for 2019, including revising the payout calculation methodology, setting appropriately rigorous absolute payout thresholds and updating the relative payout scale. The CMDC also made several enhancements to our executive compensation disclosures. Our Proxy Statement has a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section that includes further details of our executive pay program.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 9\nINTRODUCTIONINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESADVANCING\nSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nPROMOTING SOUND GOVERNANCE\nOur Corporate Culture \nHaving clear and consistent policies and processes is essential to sound governance, but creating a corporate culture that reinforces and \nrewards adherence to them is equally vital. Our efforts focus on fostering an environment where all employees uphold the highest ethical standards and our Business Principles in all of their engagements. We reinforce these expectations through various channels and by encouraging our senior leaders to communicate clearly and frequently with employees.  \nOur efforts are also focused on promoting a culture of respect that allows every employee to feel safe and empowered at work. This includes \nhaving in place employee training and protocols for preventing, reporting and addressing behavior that is not in line with our Business Principles and standards. The firm prohibits retaliation against any individual who reports a concern or assists with an inquiry or investigation.  \nAt the Board level, the CMDC provides oversight of the governance framework of our firmwide culture, including receiving updates from \nmanagement regarding significant conduct issues. In addition, the CMDC holds a periodic joint session with the Risk Committee in which Directors are briefed on culture- and conduct-related matters.\nOur Control Environment \nOur control agenda is a top priority for the firm, and we devote significant resources to adhering and adapting to the substantial number of regulatory expectations and reporting requirements that guide our industry. We have a culture and infrastructure that emphasize compliance and issue escalation and remediation, as well as checks and balances designed to prevent issues and address those identified before they become problems. We regularly engage regulators in dialogue as we develop appropriate remediation plans.  \nOur firm continuously seeks ways to strengthen our control environment and to simplify and appropriately mitigate risk in our operations. We dedicate significant financial and human resources to managing these efforts across the company.  \nOur control environment, which is supported by other functions, \nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal, is structured as follows, and additional details are available in our Annual Report .\nLines of Business \nOur firm’s lines of business are each responsible for identifying and addressing risks within their respective businesses and operating within a sound control environment. The Control Management function, which consists of control managers within each of the lines of business and corporate functions, provides dedicated support to business leaders. Control managers, jointly accountable with business executives, are charged with enhancing the firm’s control environment by promoting early operational risk identification and assessment, effectively designing and evaluating controls and developing solutions to mitigate risk. This structure is designed to enable the firm to detect control problems quickly, escalate issues promptly and engage other stakeholders to understand common themes and interdependencies among the various parts of the firm. The firm’s overall objective is to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors and protects the safety and soundness of the firm. Risks are generally categorized in the following risk types:\n~Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation \nassociated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate response to changes in the operating environment.\n~Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk and investment portfolio risk.\n~Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\n~Operational risk is the risk associated with an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the firm’s processes or systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal and estimations and model risk.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance ReportINTRODUCTIONINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESADVANCING\nSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nPROMOTING SOUND GOVERNANCE\n10\nConduct Risk Management\nConduct risk is the risk that any action or inaction by an employee or employees could lead to unfair client or customer outcomes, \nimpact the integrity of the markets in which the firm operates or compromise the firm’s reputation. Our firm has an established policy framework for the governance, identification, measurement, monitoring and testing, management and reporting of conduct risk within the firm, as well as mechanisms to provide oversight of the firm’s conduct initiatives and to escalate systemic conduct risk issues when appropriate. Each line of business and corporate function is accountable for identifying and managing conduct risk within its operations, and multiple Board committees share oversight of conduct risk. \nOur Code of Conduct (Code) sets forth the firm’s expectations for all of our employees when it comes to maintaining a safe, productive, \ndiverse, professional, collegial and secure work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. All new hires are assigned Code training and all employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code periodically. Each member of the Board also periodically affirms his or her compliance with the Code. \nIndependent Risk Management \nIndependent Risk Management, which consists of the Risk Management and Compliance organizations, sets and oversees the risk management structure for the firm, including the definition of policies and standards. These organizations operate independently from the lines of business.\nInternal Audit \nInternal Audit, a function independent of the lines of business and Risk Management and Compliance, tests and evaluates the firm’s risk governance and management, as well as its internal control processes. This function brings a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of the firm’s governance, risk management and internal control processes. \nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity is one of the biggest threats facing the global financial system, and it continues to be a top priority for the firm. Our strategy is designed to securely enable new business and technology initiatives while maintaining a relentless focus on protecting the firm, our clients and customers and our third-party partners and vendors. We devote significant resources to protecting and continuously improving the security of our systems, and we partner with leading technology companies to identify solutions to meet the fast-evolving threat landscape.Global Financial Crimes Compliance\nGlobal financial crime has significant adverse societal impacts and undermines confidence in the financial system, which is why our firm dedicates significant resources to fighting it. JPMorgan Chase is committed to participating in international efforts to combat money laundering and the funding of terrorist activities. The firm operates a risk-based global Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance Program designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing in the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which the firm operates.\nJPMorgan Chase is a founding member of the financial \nindustry’s leading forum on financial crimes risk, the Wolfsberg Group, and we are proud to work with our fellow group members to continually develop principles and industry standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.\nIn addition, our firm operates a Global Sanctions \nCompliance Program that consists of (i) procedures, systems and internal controls designed to comply with applicable sanctions; (ii) a designated person responsible for the day-to-day implementation and operation of the program; (iii) independent testing; (iv) an ongoing training program; and (v) reporting and record keeping.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 11\nINTRODUCTIONINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESADVANCING\nSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nPROMOTING SOUND GOVERNANCE\nThe JPMorgan Chase cybersecurity team consists of professionals \nacross all lines of business and geographies where the firm has operations and works 24 hours a day, seven days a week to detect, analyze, track and mitigate external threats. We also educate, train and test all employees on cybersecurity vigilance because we view every employee as our first line of defense.\nWe understand cybersecurity’s potential to impact global financial \nstability and we are focused on the firm’s role in building and maintaining systemic resiliency. We are a leader in the Financial Services Information Sharing & Analysis Center, which is an intelligence-sharing cooperative for the financial services sector. Its nearly 7,000 members share intelligence, best practices and exercises to better secure the sector for the benefit of the public and the resiliency and integrity of financial institutions. Our firm also helped drive the creation of the Financial Systemic Analysis and Resilience Center, which is an industry-funded nonprofit whose mission is to increase the resilience of the systems that underpin the U.S. financial services sector. \nCollaborating and cooperating with government agencies and \nregulators is vital to effective cybersecurity. We maintain open lines of communication with government representatives and law enforcement agencies to share relevant information. In addition, JPMorgan Chase is a leading voice on a global industry workstream on regulatory harmonization, seeking to streamline the fragmented cybersecurity regulatory environment that is currently a patchwork of different standards, frameworks and requirements from over 150 global regulators. Our goal is to enable more efficient and effective cybersecurity supervisory oversight, while also helping to increase security and resiliency.\nPolitical Engagement and \nPublic Policy\nJPMorgan Chase believes that responsible corporate \ncitizenship demands a strong commitment to a healthy and informed democracy through civic and community involvement. Our business is subject to extensive laws and regulations, and changes to such laws can significantly affect how we operate, our revenues and the costs we incur. Because of the impact public policy can have on our businesses, employees, communities and customers, we engage with policymakers on a range of issues—including banking, financial services, cybersecurity, workforce development, small business, tax, trade and inclusive economic growth, among others—to advance and protect the long-term interests of the firm. In addition, in 2019 we launched the JPMorgan Chase \nPolicy Center to develop and \nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions that drive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the world. The \nPolicy Center’s first focus is removing barriers to \nemployment for people with a criminal background. \nThe firm belongs to a number of trade associations that \nadvocate on major public policy issues of importance to the firm and the communities we serve. The firm’s participation as a member of these associations comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with all the positions of an association or its other members, and that we are committed to voicing our concerns as appropriate. The Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of our positions and practices on public responsibility matters, including significant policies and practices regarding political contributions, major lobbying priorities and principal trade association memberships. \nWe aim to operate with the highest standards of public \ntransparency in political spending. Our efforts have been recognized by the 2019 CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability, which credited our firm as a Trendsetter in its 2019 report. In addition, in early 2019 we made enhancements to our disclosures, which are available on our website . \n Additional Online Resources\n~Annual Report\n~Board Committees\n~Business Principles  \n~Code of Conduc\nt\n~Code of Ethics for Finance Professionals\n~Corporate Governance Principles\n~Diversity and Inclusion\n~Environmental and Social Policy Framework~Global Financial Crimes Compliance\n~How We Do Business— \n \nThe Report\n~Human Righ\nts Statement\n~Political Engagement and Public Policy\n~Proxy Statement\n~Suppliers Information\n~U.K. Modern Slavery Act Group Statement\nFor additional information, please visit www.jpmorganchase.com/ESG.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

We strive to provide our clients and customers with exceptional service in everything we do.  \nThis section focuses principally on our CCB business, which serves consumers and small \nbusinesses across the U.S. under the Chase brand. We help our customers manage their money, purchase homes and vehicles, save and invest for the future, start and grow businesses and achieve their financial goals. We do so by using our expertise to help our customers make the most of their money and by continually innovating and developing products and services to enable them to bank however they choose—from their mobile phone, on their computer, at an ATM or at a Chase branch. \nSince 2018, our firm has entered 16 new markets and opened more than 90 of the \n400 new Chase branches we are planning across the U.S. as part of a nationwide market expansion effort. The new branches give us a presence in 38 states and Washington, D.C., as of year-end 2019.Who We Serve:\n~63 million households \n~4 million small business customers \n~52 million activ\ne digital users, includin g \n37 million active on mobile\n2019–At a Glance: \n~Originated $105 billion in mortgages \n~Opened 8 million credit card acc ounts \n~Received 35% of all check deposits through mobile phones\n~Proc\nessed an average of $3 billion in \ncredit and debit payments every day Helping Customers Make the \nMost of Their Money \nServing 63 million households, we have a deep understanding of the financial lives of \nconsumers. We are using that insight to develop affordable, innovative and scalable products to help customers strengthen their financial health. \nOne way we do this is by offering products designed to make it easier for our \ncustomers to save and invest. For example, in early 2019, we introduced our low-fee Chase Secure Banking\nsm account (see p. 17), as well as Autosave, which lets \ncustomers set up automatic transfers to their savings accounts and monitor progress through a savings dashboard. A total of 1.4 million customers used Autosave in 2019, transferring $1.5 billion to their savings accounts. Also in 2019, we launched My Chase Loan, which gives customers a hassle-free way to use the available credit on their credit cards at a lower Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and with fewer fees than a typical personal loan or cash advance. In addition, we empower all types of investors to build their savings and grow their wealth through our You Invest\nsm\ndigital investment platform. Approximately 90% of You Investsm clients are first-time \ninvestors with Chase.    \nWe also created Credit Journeysm, a free, online tool to help consumers track and \nmanage their credit scores. All consumers, whether or not they are Chase customers, \ncan check their credit score at any time and receive alerts about changes, as well as learn what affects their score and find advice on how to improve it. By year-end 2019, 22 million people had enrolled in Credit Journey\nsm.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

During 2019, we originated over 1.1 million small business loans for a total of $18.4 billion in the states where we have a branch presence, an increase of 19% in capital extended from the year before.\nWe know that minority, women, veteran and other underserved \nentrepreneurs face distinct barriers to starting and growing their businesses, so we have a number of efforts designed to help them get access to the capital, expertise and networks crucial for success. For example, through our Women on the Move global initiative, we are helping women start and grow businesses (see p. 21), including a goal to provide $10 billion in credit to women business owners through 2021. By the end of 2019, we had extended approximately $4 billion toward this goal, putting us ahead of pace. \nIn addition, we have committed $150 million in philanthropic \ncapital to help underserved entrepreneurs build and grow their businesses. Through the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund (see p. 25), we support community lending organizations that provide minority entrepreneurs with access to capital, education and other resources. \nWe are also using our global purchasing power to support \ndiverse suppliers, spending more than $2 billion annually with companies owned and operated by historically underrepresented groups, many of which are small businesses. Our firm is proud to be a member of The Billion Dollar Roundtable—a nonprofit that recognizes corporations that spend at least $1 billion with minority and woman-owned suppliers—for our commitment to supplier diversity.\nEngaging with \nCustomers\nWe regularly engage with our customers, consumer groups and \nother stakeholders with a goal of developing products, services and approaches that are responsive to their needs and address the issues that matter most to them. We have established forums, known as Chase Advisory Panels, for local, regional and national stakeholders to share with our senior executives their perspectives on community development needs, public policy and regulatory issues. In addition, we conduct hundreds of meetings annually with community-based organizations. \nWe solicit customers’ direct feedback on their experiences and \nneeds through a range of channels, including in person at our branches, through our website, via social media and customer satisfaction surveys. In addition, we collect customer feedback through external media and ratings agencies. We take this feedback seriously and use it to improve our approach and offerings.Helping Our Small Business \nCustomers Weather the Crisis\nWe know how important small businesses are to their \ncommunities—and how much they rely on cash flow and access to capital. So, when the COVID-19 crisis hit, we quickly took steps to support our small business customers, including allowing them to defer payments on loans, lines of credit and business credit cards. We are also providing much-needed capital by accelerating access to funding and extending new loans for our small business customers. We are working to help as many of our customers as possible receive loans through the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. In addition, we immediately began deploying philanthropic capital to support vulnerable and underserved small businesses around the world.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 14INTRODUCTIONINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nSERVING OUR CUSTOMERS\nTreating Customers Fairly\nIn order to earn and maintain the trust of our customers, we must treat them fairly and be clear and transparent in how we communicate \nand engage with them. We work to do this by having policies and procedures aimed at simplifying our disclosures, products and services \nand operations; aligning our sales practices with our customers’ interests; and taking rigorous measures to safeguard the privacy of \ncustomers’ information.\nWe regularly review and look for ways to make it easier for customers to navigate our full range of products and services available across \nour branch network. In addition, we are reevaluating the qualification requirements for new product features and benefits and taking \nsteps aimed at ensuring the exercise of employee discretion in product accessibility works as intended.\nProviding Fair and Transparent Marketing\nWe want our customers to make informed choices about their \nfinances and banking options, and we empower them to do so \nby working to provide clear, concise and transparent information \nabout our products and services. To deliver on this objective, \nin 2019 we established the Disclosure Center of Excellence, a \ncontrol team driving the consistent use of disclosures across our \nCCB and AWM businesses. The team is responsible for ensuring \nthat these businesses have access to up-to-date disclosure \nlanguage that meets regulatory requirements and firmwide \nguidelines so they can best serve their clients and customers. \nAligning Employees’ Incentives with \nCustomers’ Interests\nOur objective is to provide our customers with the right products \nand services to meet their financial needs, and we train, assess \nand reward our employees accordingly. Every year, we train \nour bankers on our customer-centered policies, procedures and \ncontrols, and we evaluate their performance on these metrics, \nalongside revenue and profitability. \nWe reward bankers for providing customers with a positive \noverall experience and products and services they need and use. \nWe also review our sales practices, including culture, incentive \nplans, controls assessments and feedback received from customers and employees through various channels, including \nour employee Code Reporting Hotline. By merging all of this \nfeedback, we help safeguard our reputation and align employee \nperformance with the best interests of our customers.Protecting the Elderly and Vulnerable \nfrom Financial Abuse \nWe continue our work to increase awareness about potential \nfinancial abuse affecting elderly and vulnerable populations. To \nbetter protect our customers, we look for innovative solutions \nin data analytics and machine learning, while also concentrating \non ongoing training and communication with our frontline \nemployees. We are also working with nonprofit organizations, \nadvocacy groups, regulators, law enforcement and others to \nexplore strategies and best practices for combating exploitation \nof elderly and vulnerable customers.\nSafeguarding Customer Privacy \nand Data Security\nProtecting our customers’ personal and financial information \nis a priority for our firm. We have robust internal policies and \nsecurity measures aimed at keeping our customers’ personal and \nfinancial information safe, and we hold our suppliers and vendors \nto high standards for data security. \nConsumers want to know our firm is safeguarding their personal \ninformation and to understand how it is used. We strive to \nprovide customers with clear, user-friendly explanations of our \nprivacy policies that explain how we collect, share, use and \nprotect their information, and outline steps they can take to limit the sharing of personal information. We protect customer \ninformation through a wide range of technological, procedural \nand physical security measures. In addition, our Code of Conduct \nand related policies for ethical business conduct include specific \nguidelines about how employees should safeguard customers’ \nconfidential information. \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 15INTRODUCTIONINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\nSERVING OUR \nCUSTOMERS\nWe are investing in enhanced data privacy and security solutions \nto safeguard information shared via our suite of online and \nmobile banking tools. For example, in 2019 we announced an \nagreement with leading data aggregator Envestnet l Yodlee, \nwhich gives Chase customers more visibility and control of their \ndata. With the new agreement, Envestnet I Yodlee will send 100% \nof its requests for Chase customer data through our firm’s secure \nApplication Programming Interface (API). This will give customers \ncontrol over what is shared and with whom, including enabling \nthem to monitor every financial app that retrieves their data and \nsee all linked accounts and which information they are sharing. \nWe also continue to expand our usage of machine learning and \nintelligent strategies to improve detection and mitigation of \nfraud across our products and services. This technology allows \nus to more accurately detect potentially fraudulent activity for \nour customers and approve more legitimate transactions. Each \nyear, we anticipate these systems will help prevent nearly one \nmillion more fraudulent credit card transactions that may have \npreviously been approved, while simultaneously approving nearly \none million additional legitimate transactions that would have been incorrectly declined. These machine learning capabilities, \nalong with other initiatives, have also enabled us to reduce our \ncredit card fraud loss rate by approximately 50% since 2014.    \nServing Low- and \nModerate-Income \nCustomers\nWe are committed to developing products and services that \nmeet the needs of all segments of our customer base, including \nthose specifically designed to serve low- and moderate-income \ncustomers. This includes taking steps to make homeownership \nmore accessible; expanding our branch presence in low- and \nmoderate-income neighborhoods; offering resources in our \nbranches such as financial coaching; developing products that \nprovide safe, high-quality and affordable ways to access banking \nservices; and more. Expanding Homeownership\nIn 2018, our firm made a five-year commitment to finance $50 \nbillion of mortgages in low- and moderate-income communities. \nBy the end of 2019, we had financed $22 billion of those \nmortgages, or 44% of the five-year goal. \nWe continue to serve more low- and moderate-income customers \nwith our DreaMaker™ mortgage, which allows buyers to make \na down payment of as little as 3% and offers an affordable \nmonthly payment. In 2019, DreaMaker™ accounted for 21% of our \nhome-purchase mortgages. With DreaMaker™, buyers can earn \na $500 grant by completing a financial educational program to prepare them for homeownership. To reduce the cash required \nfor closing costs and a down payment, we also offer a Chase \nHomebuyer Grant of $2,500 to customers purchasing a home in \nlow- or moderate-income census tracts across the U.S. More than \n8,900 homebuyers benefited from this program in 2019. These \nproducts and programs complement the suite of other affordable \nloan products and programs we have long offered, including \nFederal Housing Administration and U.S. Department of Veterans \nAffairs mortgages.  \nRecognizing that homeownership is not possible or desirable \nfor some consumers, JPMorgan Chase is dedicated to creating \nand preserving affordable rental housing for low-income \ncommunities across the country. In 2018, we committed to lend \n$7 billion over five years to commercial and nonprofit housing \npartners to help maintain, rehabilitate and build affordable units. \nBy the end of 2019, we had already lent $5.6 billion toward that \ncommitment, including more than $3.3 billion in 2019 alone. \nGrowing Our Branch Presence \nOur retail bank branches are an important way that we serve \nour customers and provide access to banking services. We plan \nto open 30% of the 400 new branches in our market expansion \nprogram in low- and moderate-income communities. We have \na higher proportion of our branches and ATMs in low- and \nmoderate-income communities across the country than the \nindustry overall.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

The branch offers unique programming in money management and financial planning; digital coaching on job, small business and computer skills; a pop-up space for local small businesses; and a hub for us to showcase and test new retail banking technology before it rolls out nationwide. \nBroadening Access to Banking Services\nAnother crucial way we support low- and moderate-income communities is by striving to create products that provide safe, high-quality and affordable ways to access banking services. For example, in early 2019, we launched Chase Secure Banking\nsm, \na Bank On certified checking account.1 For a flat monthly fee, \ncustomers get all the benefits of banking with Chase without check-cashing fees, minimum balances to open an account or overdraft fees. \nWe know that small businesses also play an essential role in \ncreating jobs and generating economic opportunity, especially in low- and moderate-income areas. In 2019, we made more than 265,000 small business loans—totaling more than $4.5 billion—in low- and moderate-income communities. That is approximately 19% of our total small business lending. \nIn addition, we support technology-based innovations to improve \nthe financial lives of low- and moderate-income Americans through the Financial Solutions Lab (see p. 26), managed by the Financial Health Network in collaboration with founding partner, JPMorgan Chase.Additional Online Resources\n~Accessibility at Chase\n~Annual Report\n~Business Principles\n~Chase Privacy Policy\n~COVID-19 Response\n~Financial Health\n~JPMorgan Chase Institute\n~Proxy Statement\n~Small Business Expansion\nFor additional information, please visit www.jpmorganchase.com/ESG.\n1Bank On is Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund’s standard for safe, affordable and appropriate accounts that meet the needs of low-income consumers.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

We seek to foster a strong culture—based on our core values of respect, integrity and inclusion—where employees feel that they belong and where they want to stay.\nAs technological and other changes in our economy alter traditional career paths and \nbusiness needs, one focus of our human capital strategy is building a future-ready workforce that is prepared to adapt to the trends that are transforming jobs at our firm.

Fostering diversity and inclusion has long been a focus for our firm, and we are proud of the progress we have made.\nWe recognize, however, that we have more work to do. After the media reported \non alleged discrimination in our firm last year, we undertook a major effort to evaluate our policies, procedures and programs to ensure they are fair for all employees and customers. We found opportunities to increase awareness about the firm's Diversity and Inclusion strategy, and we identified a need to expand our diversity recruitment efforts to hire more diverse talent and to implement mandatory firmwide training. We are also taking steps to strengthen how we serve our customers by reviewing our full spectrum of consumer offerings to enhance access to our products and services, as well as increasing the diversity of the businesses with which we partner. We know that these and other efforts we have underway to strengthen our culture demand ongoing work and sustained commitment.\nTo drive performance and enhance transparency, we are expanding the \nworkforce composition data we report and providing more information on our strategy on the Diversity and Inclusion section of our website.Who We Are: \nKey 2019 Statistics\nWe have nearly 257,000 employees \nworking in 62 countries worldwide, approximately two-thirds of whom are based in the U.S. \nGender Demographics\nGlobal Workforce\n51%   49%\nOperating Committee\n50%   50%\nManagement Team\n75%   25%\nCampus & Internship Class\n58%   42%\nEthnic Demographics2\nGlobal Workforce\n51% 49%\nOperating Committee\n8% 92%\nManagement Team\n19% 81%\nCampus & Internship Class\n55% 45%Men Women\nU.S. Ethnic U.S. White\n2Numbers reflect U.S. workforce only. \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 18PROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nINVESTING IN  \nOU\nR EMPLOYEES\nHiring Great People \nTo deliver exceptional service to our clients, customers and \ncommunities, we aim to hire the best people. Diversity is a priority \nthroughout our hiring process, and we seek candidates from a wide \nrange of backgrounds and experiences for positions at all levels. \nWe look to hire people who have the skills and expertise we need, \nusing standard processes for assessing and selecting candidates.\nBuilding a Strong and Diverse \nTalent Pipeline\nWe have a number of efforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including \ninitiatives focused on women, underrepresented ethnic groups, \npeople with disabilities, veterans and others.\nWe know that strengthening our pipeline of diverse future leaders \nis essential, so we have campus recruiting programs that help us \nconnect with diverse candidates for internships and post-graduation \nroles as part of our Emerging Talent Program (ETP), which \ncomplements existing recruiting efforts. The ETP team oversees a \nrange of employment opportunities for cognitively, experientially \nand traditionally diverse individuals who are often underrepresented in typical talent pipelines. To support our recruitment efforts, we \nalso have structured partnerships with key diversity organizations, \nand we have long-standing relationships with Historically Black \nColleges and Universities (HBCUs). In 2019, our firm was the top \noverall employer at three HBCUs: Howard University, Morehouse \nCollege and Spelman College.  \nIn 2019, we continued to maintain best-in-class diversity hiring \nfor our 2020 intern class, which was 47% female globally and in \nthe U.S., 13% black and 16% Hispanic. This included efforts as part of our Advancing Black Pathways (ABP) initiative (see p. 21). \nWe are equally focused on diversity in our experienced hiring, \nwhich is delivering results. In 2019, for example, more than \n55% of the Managing Directors we hired were diverse—defined \nby groups of ethnicity and race, as outlined by the U.S. Census \nBureau, and inclusive of women globally—an increase of nearly \n15% compared to 2018. Creating More Inclusive Inroads to \nCareers at Our Firm\nOur emphasis is on hiring people with the skills we need, not \nparticular degrees. In fact, in 2019 more than 75% of the jobs \nposted by JPMorgan Chase in the U.S. did not require a bachelor’s \ndegree. While our firm continues to value four-year college and \nadvanced degrees, we are also increasingly turning to new and \nmore diverse sources to recruit the talent we need. One way \nwe are doing this is by partnering with community colleges and \nrecruiting those with associate degrees. We are also looking to \napprenticeship programs, bootcamps and other partners to create \nmore inroads to careers at our firm. For example, through our ETP portfolio we offer a range of apprenticeships and other entry-level \nskill development opportunities. \nThrough our Second Chance initiative, we launched an effort to \nexpand opportunities for individuals with criminal backgrounds to \npursue careers at JPMorgan Chase (see p. 21). This means qualified \napplicants with criminal histories receive the same consideration \nas any other applicant, and in 2019 it resulted in approximately \n3,000 people with criminal backgrounds hired—roughly 10% of our \nnew hires. We also launched a pilot program to further build our pipeline for hiring people with criminal histories. \nTraining and \nCareer Development  \nSupporting our employees’ professional development is a core \nfocus of our human capital strategy. We invest approximately \n$200 million a year in tools and training programs to help our \nemployees build their knowledge, skills and experience. And, \nin 2019, we delivered nearly 10 million hours of training to \nemployees across the globe on topics including business processes \nand products, leadership and professional development, risk \nand compliance and technology, among others. In addition to \nour internal training efforts, we provide tuition assistance to \nemployees who are seeking to further build their skills. \nWe also support employees by facilitating career advancement and \nmobility within the firm. In 2019, we filled 42% of all positions and \n67% of our most senior-level roles with internal candidates.PROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR \nCOMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 19\nDelivering Best-in-Class \nLeadership Training\nLeadership Edge is our firmwide initiative to enable leaders at \nall levels to grow and succeed throughout their careers. The program, which has been recognized as a best-in-class leadership development platform, offers in-person training focused on core leadership skills, people management and further embedding our Business Principles into our culture. By the end of 2019, 74% of our 40,000 managers had attended one or more programs since the introduction of Leadership Edge in 2015. \nInvesting in New Skilling\nWe are creating more paths for career mobility and preparing our employees to adapt to the trends that are transforming jobs at our firm through a concerted focus on new skilling. The employees in the roles that will be most affected by technological changes—such as our operations and entry-level positions—are a highly diverse employee population. Providing these individuals with opportunities to build skills that facilitate career mobility and improve retention is, therefore, a key part of our strategy to advance diversity and inclusion within our firm.   \nWe are committed to providing employees with opportunities for \nongoing development and career advancement. In 2019, through our Lifelong Learning program, we launched New Skills at Work to address talent needs across the firm. We have proactively defined business-critical future skills—such as data and tech literacy, analytical thinking and project management—and we are developing and expanding access to opportunities for our people to build the identified skills. The New Skills at Work program will support employees as they navigate changes and compete for emerging jobs at JPMorgan Chase. The goal is to expand the program in phases to all of our employees. \nIn addition, through our Skills of the Future online curriculum, \nwe are helping employees increase their digital fluency. In 2019, nearly 20,000 unique users took part in one of our Data and Tech Literacy course offerings. And through our Power-Up Learning Journey, our firm trained over 10,000 of our tellers, facilitating their career progression and graduation to Associate Bankers.Skills-Based Volunteering\nOur firm leverages the talent of our people to maximize the impact of our philanthropic programs. In 2019, 325 employees from 14 countries contributed nearly 20,000 hours working with about 70 nonprofits through the JPMorgan Chase Service Corps, our signature skills-based program through which employees volunteer their skills and expertise to help our nonprofit partners build capacity. And, through our Force for Good program, 1,300 employee volunteers gave nearly 60,000 hours of their time to develop sustainable tech solutions for 200 nonprofit organizations. \nIn addition to these programs, we provide a range of \nother opportunities for our employees to volunteer their expertise to support the communities we serve. In 2019, many employees around the world lent their knowledge and time helping drive more inclusive growth, from advising women-led businesses and mission-driven fintech entrepreneurs to mentoring young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\nA Workplace for \nEveryone\nWe want to be an employer of choice for people from all \nbackgrounds and experiences, and a place where all employees feel like they belong. By striving to create an inclusive work environment that supports all heritages, cultures, abilities, work styles and lifestyles, our goal is to attract and retain the best people and be positioned to meet the diverse needs of our clients, customers and communities. \nWe continually work to promote a culture of respect that allows \nevery employee to feel safe and empowered at work. Our Equal Opportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Statement —\nwhich we made publicly available on our website in early 2020—sets forth our policies and expectations for our employees, and all employees are required to take anti-harassment awareness training. Additionally, we have implemented a framework for unconscious bias and inclusion training for managers, called Journey to Inclusive Teams, which provides training as well as other internal resources, such as decision-making tools and guides.   \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 20PROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are an essential part of how \nwe cultivate an inclusive work environment. These are groups of \nemployees who volunteer to advance the firm’s position in the global \nmarketplace and diversity and inclusion strategies by leveraging \nthe unique perspectives of their members. Our firm has ten BRGs \nglobally focused on ethnic communities and other groups, including \nHispanic and Latino, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, military \nand veterans, LGBT+ employees, women, people with disabilities, \nearly career employees, administrative professionals and working \nfamilies. Approximately 43% of our employees were members of at least one BRG in 2019.\nWe also have a variety of executive forums designed to support \nand advance diversity and inclusion within our firm. For example, \nthe Hispanic Executive Forum serves as a senior collective voice \nfor the Hispanic and Latino community and supports the Adelante \nBRG and other Hispanic leadership forums across the firm’s lines \nof business; engages with external organizations; and supports the \nfirm’s campus hiring, new employee on-boarding and retention and \ndevelopment efforts among the Hispanic and Latino community. The Asian Executive Forum similarly partners with the AsPIRE BRG \nand supports the firm’s commitment to the Asian American and \nPacific Islander community through recruitment, development, \nadvancement and external engagement. \nHere are some other examples of how our firm is taking a \ndeliberate approach to supporting and investing in the success of \nparticular communities: \nChampioning Women\nIn recent years, we have significantly expanded our Women on the Move initiative, which we originally launched in 2013 \nto provide women at all levels of our firm with a platform to \nexchange ideas and support their career development. Today, the \nprogram focuses not only on women inside our firm but also on \nclients and customers through three strategic pillars: expanding \nwomen-run businesses, improving women’s financial health and \nempowering women’s career growth (see p. 14). We also continue \nto support women’s advancement within the firm. As of the end \nof 2019, women made up 50% of our Operating Committee. In addition, we are expanding our efforts to support working \nparents and families (see p. 23). Investing in the Black Community\nIn 2019, we marked the third anniversary of our firm’s Advancing \nBlack Leaders (ABL) strategy to increase representation of black \ntalent across all of our businesses. While we have much more \nto do, this strategy is delivering tangible results, especially \nat senior levels of the firm. We expanded the ABL strategy to \nour Europe, Middle East and Africa region, which resulted in \nour doubling the number of black Managing Directors in those \nregions between 2018 and 2019.  \nWe also launched ABP in 2019, which builds on the success \nof our internal ABL strategy and extends our commitment to helping black Americans achieve economic success in our \ncommunities. This initiative combines the firm’s business and \nphilanthropic resources to accelerate economic opportunity for \nblack Americans by strengthening education and job training, \ngrowing careers and building wealth. As part of this program, \nwe committed to hiring more than 4,000 black students over \nthe next five years into apprenticeships, internships and post-\ngraduation roles. In 2019—our first year working toward this \ncommitment—we achieved 25% of the target. \nProviding Opportunities to \nPeople with Disabilities\nThe global Office of Disability Inclusion (ODI) provides consistent \nstandards and processes to better accommodate employees and \nstrategic direction to the firm with a focus on recruiting, hiring \nand advancing individuals with disabilities. As part of the firm’s \ndisability inclusion and well-being strategy, we are also working \nto reduce stigmas and dispel myths around mental illness in \nthe workplace. This is Me™, the firm’s ongoing mental health \nawareness campaign, does just that through events, videos, \ntoolkits and other resources. Nearly 100 employees have shared \nstories about their mental health journeys on our corporate intranet. Additionally, about 80,000 employees leverage \nmeQuilibrium, the firm’s stress and resilience program. Our goal \nis to make JPMorgan Chase the employer of choice for people \nwith disabilities—both visible and hidden—by removing barriers \nand providing the right level of support when they need it.

Environmental Social & Governance Report 21\nHiring and Supporting Veterans\nOur firm’s Office of Military and Veterans Affairs drives our \nfirmwide strategy to support veterans through employment, entrepreneurship and private-sector leadership on veteran talent. Since 2011, JPMorgan Chase has hired more than 15,000 U.S. veterans—including over 1,200 in 2019 alone—with more than 65% coming from diverse backgrounds. We offer internship and rotational entry programs to support the transition of military personnel and veterans into the financial services industry. We support our veteran employees through mentorship programs, acclimation and development initiatives, recognition events and other programs to help bridge the gap between military and corporate cultures. Additionally, we offer paid military leave for all types of military service. \nSupporting Our \nEmployees\nOur firm is committed to supporting our employees, including their \nphysical, emotional and financial well-being. \nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic struck, we put this commitment \ninto action by taking steps to protect and support our employees and their families. We implemented alternative work arrangements and reinforced both personal and office hygiene measures to keep our employees and clients safe by modifying business operations, staggering shifts, changing seating, closing buildings to nonessential visitors and providing additional equipment where possible. \nWe are continuing to pay branch employees for their regularly \nscheduled hours, even if their hours are reduced or their branch is temporarily closed. We are encouraging employees to stay home when appropriate by providing 14 days of full pay for precautionary situations. In addition, for employees who felt they were higher risk and could not work, we provided an extended leave through May 2, 2020. And we provided five additional paid days off for all employees to help them manage personal issues, such as dependent care, childcare or other needs. In addition, to help meet challenges related to issues like childcare and transportation, we are making a special payment of up to $1,000 to full- and part-time employees whose jobs require them to continue working on-site and generally have annual cash compensation of less than $60,000.\nSupporting the LGBT+ Community in \nOur Workplace and Beyond\nOur global PRIDE BRG, which focuses on the community who \nidentify as LGBT+ and allies, had nearly 24,000 members in 2019, up 35% from the year prior. In 2019, we also created our LGBT+ Executive Forum, a group of Out LGBT+ Managing Directors and Executive Directors across 13 countries, to drive increased engagement and visibility of our LGBT+ senior leaders and advance topics important to our LGBT+ community. In recent years, our firm has taken a number of steps to better meet the needs of this employee population. For example, we have improved family planning benefits and transgender medical benefits for LGBT+ employees, as well as rolled out same-sex partner benefits and gender reassignment surgery coverage in certain geographies. In recognition of our workplace practices, JPMorgan Chase has received a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index every year since its inception 18 years ago.\nOur firm’s efforts to advance equality and acceptance for those \nwho identify as LGBT+ do not stop with our own workforce; we are also lending our voice to efforts in our communities. In 2019, for example, we signed public statements in support of marriage equality in Japan and Hong Kong, as well as a U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in support of LGBT+ workers seeking to be protected from discrimination under existing federal civil rights laws. We also engage with and support external LGBT+ organizations around the world. \nEmployee Compensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits. We have governance mechanisms, systems and controls in place that are intended to provide our employees equitable pay for the work that they do, regardless of who they are. In recent years we increased wages for U.S. employees at the lower end of our pay scale by 10% on average, ranging from between $15 and $18 per hour. \nOur benefits package includes health care coverage, retirement \nbenefits, life and disability insurance, wellness and employee assistance programs, competitive vacation and leave policies, tuition reimbursement programs and more. We consciously direct our benefit spend toward lower-wage earners and provide those employees with higher insurance subsidies and lower deductibles.  \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 22PROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES\nSupporting Working Parents and \nFamily Building \nWe offer parental and adoption leave programs with a minimum \nof 16 weeks of fully paid parental leave for employees who are primary caregivers. In 2019, we increased the amount of paid leave we provide to nonprimary caregivers following the birth or adoption placement of a child to a minimum of six weeks, up from two weeks. \nWe also help our employees build families through our medical \nbenefits program, which includes coverage for infertility, as well as through policies such as adoption assistance and surrogacy benefits. In 2019, we expanded fertility benefits to individuals without a medical diagnosis of infertility and we increased financial support for surrogacy.  \nWe have flexible work options to support parents and others who \nneed alternative work schedules, and we provide backup childcare in select markets and other assistance to working parents. In 2019, we increased our support for nursing mothers by launching a new lactation consulting program and breast milk shipping options for our employees who are traveling. Since 2013, we have recruited talent through the ReEntry Program, which is a competitive fellowship for individuals who are returning to the workforce after having taken a career break for at least two years for personal reasons, including, but not limited to, caring for family members who are young, ill or elderly.  \nEncouraging Health and Wellness\nWe offer a comprehensive wellness program that includes a range of resources to empower and inspire our employees to manage and improve their health. Globally, we have 34 on-site health and wellness centers, and more than half of our U.S. employees have access to these centers. We offer all benefits-eligible employees and their covered spouses/domestic partners access to annual wellness assessments and screenings to help our employees identify potential or existing health risks. In 2019, 82% of enrolled employees and 71% of spouses/domestic partners completed both a wellness assessment and screening. \nDuring the year, we continued to expand our programs to raise \nawareness and reduce stigmas around mental illness and provide relevant support to employees. All employees have access to our Employee Assistance Program (EAP), which provides confidential counseling and support as well as manager consultations—either through on-site counselors or our extended provider network. In the U.S., we have 13 on-site clinical providers focusing on mental health and in 2019 we launched on-site EAP support and counseling in London. We also launched new resources including videos, a Manager and Employee Toolkit and a resource library on the disease of addiction. Assessing Pay Equity\nWe conduct periodic pay equity reviews at all levels. In 2019, in aggregate, women globally were paid 99% of what men were paid and U.S. minorities were paid more than 99% of what nonminorities were paid, taking into account factors such as an employee's role, tenure, seniority and geography. We are proud of the overall diversity of our workforce. However, we also know that women and minorities still are not represented in as many senior management positions as men and nonminorities. Despite the significant progress we have made, we are taking a variety of actions focused on hiring, retaining, developing and advancing women and minorities, especially at more senior levels. \nAdditional Online Resources\n~Annual Report\n~ Awards and Recognition\n~Business Principles\n~ Careers at JPMorgan Chase~ Compensation & Management Development Committee~ COVID-19 Response~ Diversity and Inclusion~ Equal Opportunity, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment \nStatement\n~ How We Do Business—The Report~ People and Culture~ Proxy Statement\nFor additional inf ormation, please visit \nw\nww.jpmorganchase.com/ESG.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 23PROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEES\nSupporting Our Communities\nCompanies like ours have a responsibility to step up and help solve pressing challenges. \nWhen communities do well, our firm does well. This conviction is reflected in how JPMorgan Chase endeavors to do business every day. We are investing in our customers, employees and communities around the world to break down barriers to opportunity and create an economy that works for more people. \nIn response to COVID-19, and in addition to efforts across the firm to support our customers and employees in need, we made an initial \n$200 million commitment to assist those most affected by humanitarian challenges, as well as create sustainable and innovative solutions to help communities recover when the crisis subsides. This commitment included $150 million in low-cost capital to help underserved small businesses and nonprofits access funding through community partners and a $50 million philanthropic investment to help address immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19. We will continue to focus on areas where we can leverage our core business, philanthropy and policy expertise to help the most vulnerable in the short and long term.\nOur Approach\nOur firm is combining our business and policy expertise, sustainable business practices, data, capital and global presence to advance solutions aimed at improving people’s lives. Our approach is strategic and data driven, and we have developed, tested and continuously refine it on the ground in communities around the world.         \nAdvancing Policy Solutions\nPublic policy is a critical tool to scale the most innovative and impactful approaches that bring about lasting change. In 2019, we launched the JPMorgan Chase \nPolicy Center to develop and \nadvance sustainable, evidence-based policy solutions designed to  drive inclusive economic growth in the U.S. and around the world.\nThe first focus area for the \nPolicy Center is advancing federal and \nstate policy changes to remove barriers to employment for people \nwith criminal backgrounds, such as “banning the box” on job applications and increasing access to education through Pell grants—which provide financial aid to low-income students—for people in prison. One in three Americans has a criminal record, which constitutes a significant barrier to employment for many people. Providing education, skills training and employment opportunities to people with arrest or conviction histories can have a huge impact. It enables them to support their families, save money and secure stable housing. It also helps reduce recidivism, increase public safety, build stronger communities and strengthen the economy. \nAnother area of focus for the \nPolicy Center is advancing local \npolicy solutions that will enable more young people—particularly \nthose who lack opportunity—to access high-quality career readiness programs that pave the way to well-paying jobs. And the \nPolicy Center will play an integral role as we respond to and \nrecover from the impacts of COVID-19. Harnessing the Power of Data\nSound public policy is informed by timely, granular data. The JPMorgan Chase Institute is dedicated to delivering data-rich analyses and expert insights for the public good. Our firm serves 63 million households through our consumer banking business, and by leveraging the unique assets and proprietary data of the firm, the Institute provides policymakers, businesses and nonprofit leaders with timely data and thoughtful analyses to help address critical issues and advance global prosperity.\nOur data allow us to better understand and answer important \nquestions about the financial health and resilience of U.S. consumers, businesses and communities, as well as study labor and financial markets. In 2019, the Institute shared valuable insights across a range of areas, including how student loan payments affect the financial lives of 4.6 million families, how Miami’s small businesses turn a profit yet have limited cash buffers and how families are weathering financial volatility on a monthly basis.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

As the world faces the \nhealth and economic consequences of COVID-19, we will lean into our core areas of expertise to support vulnerable individuals, small businesses and communities as they face financial hardship and uncertain work opportunities, a shifting business landscape and increased pressure to access or maintain affordable housing.\nPreparing Workers for the Future of Work\nTechnological change continues to transform the world of work. By 2030, more than 30% of American workers and 375 million workers globally will need to change jobs or upgrade their skills significantly to advance within the workforce. \nIn 2019, JPMorgan Chase announced a $350 million investment \nover five years to equip young people and adults with the skills to succeed in a rapidly changing economy. We are working to create greater economic mobility and career pathways for workers inside our firm (see p. 20), as well as in our communities. This new commitment includes $75 million to enable more young people to get education and real-world work experiences. Our first investment as part of this commitment was $7 million to support Denver, Colorado’s nationally recognized youth apprenticeship program and scale it to connect more underserved students to degrees and credentials aligned with in-demand careers. \nThese investments build on our firm’s long-standing efforts \nto support education, skills training and policy solutions that connect job seekers to high-quality jobs in a changing economy. Over the past six years, we have helped more than 150,000 people across 37 countries develop in-demand job skills. \nSupporting Small Businesses\nThrough our investments in communities around the world, we have seen firsthand how underserved, minority entrepreneurs have the power to lift up communities. Yet these populations often face unique barriers that inhibit their success. This is why our efforts focus on unleashing their power as drivers of opportunity. \nThrough the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, we have provided \nminority entrepreneurs in Detroit, Chicago, the South Bronx, the Bay Area and the Greater Washington region with access to capital, education and other resources. Through 2019, we committed over $17 million through the Entrepreneurs of Color Fund, resulting in more than 475 loans that created or retained over 3,000 jobs.Cultivating Thriving Neighborhoods\nHousing that individuals and families can afford, in proximity to economic opportunity and basic services, is the cornerstone of vibrant and resilient neighborhoods. Producing, preserving and protecting affordable housing is essential to our strategy for creating thriving neighborhoods. For example, as part of a $75 million commitment to the Bay Area our firm announced in early 2020 through our \nAdvancing Cities effort, we are investing $27 million \nto develop and preserve affordable housing in San Francisco and Oakland. This investment, which combines long-term, low-cost loans and philanthropic capital, will provide more affordable housing and protect local residents from being displaced. \nIn addition, we have hosted six Partnerships for Raising \nOpportunity in Neighborhoods (PRO Neighborhoods) competitions, awarding more than $131 million to over 95 community development financial institutions across the U.S. As of 2019, the winners have raised over $870 million in outside capital and made over 35,000 loans worth over $475 million dedicated to low- and moderate-income communities. In 2020, the PRO Neighborhoods Competition merged with our \nAdvancing Cities Challenge to continue to source innovative and \nsustainable solutions and address persistent problems facing communities (see p. 27).\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

We are using our data, expertise and capital to improve the financial health of customers, employees and communities. In 2019, JPMorgan Chase made a $25 million commitment to the Financial Solutions Lab, which supports technology-based innovations that address the needs of underserved consumers. This investment builds on our five-year collaboration with the Financial Solutions Lab, which has supported nearly 40 innovative fintech startups that have raised over $500 million in capital since joining the program, helping U.S. residents save more than $1 billion.\nThrough the Financial Inclusion Lab, JPMorgan Chase—in \ncollaboration with the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad’s Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship and MicroSave Consulting—is supporting innovative, technology-enabled solutions to address the financial health of people in India. Through 2019, the Financial Inclusion Lab has supported 18 fintech startups that have expanded their services to reach more than 900,000 people in underserved communities in India. Additionally, together with U.K. aid, we committed $15 million to Catalyst Fund to advance financial inclusion in emerging markets.Leveraging the Talent and \nCommitment of Our Employees \nWe leverage the considerable talent and commitment of \nour employees by connecting them with opportunities to support inclusive growth in the communities where we live, work and operate. In 2019, we implemented a new firmwide policy that provides up to eight hours of paid time off annually for volunteering and community engagement activities. And, during the year, nearly 73,000 employees volunteered 467,000 hours, which includes JPMorgan Chase Service Corps activities (see p. 20). In addition, more than 400 employees contributed to the Board Match program, which doubles the impact of eligible employees’ donations to nonprofits on whose boards they serve and resulted in the firm matching more than $1.6 million to those organizations. \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO.

Environmental Social & Governance Report 27\nSUPPORTING OUR \nCOMMUNITIESINVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND GOVERNANCEADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITYSERVING OUR CUSTOMERS INTRODUCTION\nAdvancing \nSustainability\nOur firm has operations around the world and works \nwith clients in nearly every sector of the economy, including corporations, development finance institutions, governments and investors. Across our business, we see the imperative to create a lower-carbon, more sustainable economy as more pressing than ever. Climate change, in particular, is driving a growing set of risks for business and communities around the world. At the same time, there are new opportunities to advance solutions that protect the environment, support sustainable development and grow the economy.\nJPMorgan Chase is leveraging our expertise in the financial markets to \npromote sustainable business practices and help our clients raise the capital they need to invest in projects and initiatives intended to achieve positive environmental and social outcomes. Our firm is aiming to facilitate $200 billion in financing in 2020 to drive action on climate change and advance the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This new target—which we announced in early 2020 and builds on our previous clean financing goal—represents a significant expansion of our commitment to creating a more sustainable future for clients, customers, employees and communities we serve.\nWe are focusing this financing on green initiatives, as well on social \nobjectives and economic development, including increasing access to housing, education and health care and advancing infrastructure, innovation and growth. As the world faces the health and economic consequences of COVID-19, the need for investment in sustainable development will be even more pressing. At the same time, the crisis has underscored the interconnected nature of our world, highlighting the need to take collective action to address other global challenges such as climate change. While this new target is for 2020 alone, we recognize that the issues we are tackling are significant and require sustained commitment and resources over the long term. We intend to set a new sustainable development financing target each year—with the goal to keep growing it over time.Our Firmwide \nSustainability Strategy\nBusiness \nOpportunities\nFinancing transactions that support \nclimate action and advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\nRisk \nManagement\nManaging environmental and social \nrisks that may impact our business, including risks driven by climate change\nPolicy \nEngagement \nSupporting market-based policy \nsolutions to address climate change, drive clean energy innovation and protect underserved communities\nTransparency \n& Reporting\nReporting on our approach to and \nperformance on ESG matters\nOperational \nSustainability\nWorking to source renewable energy \nfor 100% of our global power needs by the end of 2020\nEmployee \nEngagement\nLeveraging the skills and passion of our \nemployees to advance sustainability in our business and communities\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 28INVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCESERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES I\nNTRODUCTION\nADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITY\n28\nBusiness Opportunities\nJPMorgan Chase’s objective is to support our clients that are thinking strategically about the transition to a lower-carbon economy and \npositioning themselves to adapt to and capitalize on opportunities to advance sustainable solutions. We leverage our deep insight into financial markets and the expertise of our bankers, risk managers, industry experts and others to help our clients achieve their goals.  \nCorporate & Investment Bank and Commercial Banking\nOne way we help our clients meet their sustainability efforts is through our financing activities. Our goal to facilitate $200 billion in 2020 to advance the SDGs builds on and expands the previous target we set in 2017, which was to facilitate $200 billion by 2025 in clean financing. This new 2020 goal includes approximately $50 billion toward green initiatives that will also fulfill our 2017 clean financing target.\nWe established a new goal in 2020 because we were already nearly \nthree-quarters of the way toward our 2025 clean financing target —and because the environmental, social and economic needs the world is facing require us to think bigger. Effectively tackling critical global challenges like climate change requires addressing the full spectrum of development needs, as reflected in the SDGs. \nThis financing activity is principally led by our CIB and CB businesses, \nwhich collectively provide strategic advice, raise capital, extend loans and offer risk management solutions for large- and medium-sized corporations, governments and institutions. Our capabilities include:\n~Underwriting debt with a sustainable use of proceeds. In \n2019, JPMorgan Chase underwrote $14.6 billion in green bonds and bonds with a sustainable use of proceeds. For example, we served as joint bookrunner on ReNew Power’s $525 million Restricted Group green bond issuance. ReNew Power is India’s largest renewable energy independent power producer, with more than 8 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity commissioned and under construction. The proceeds from the issue were used to refinance some of ReNew’s existing debt and finance investments in new green power projects.  \n~Financing and risk management. JPMorgan Chase provides financing and risk management solutions to support clients’ renewable energy projects and to facilitate new energy, technology, transportation, waste management and water treatment innovations. For example, since 2003, JPMorgan Chase has committed or arranged over $24 billion in tax equity financing for wind, solar and geothermal energy projects in the U.S., including $3 billion for wind and solar projects in 2019.  ~Providing advisory services. JPMorgan Chase advises clients on strategic transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and capital raising. In 2019, the firm acted as a bookrunner on the initial public offering for Sunnova Energy International, Inc. [NYSE: NOVA], a residential solar and energy service provider that serves over 78,000 customers in more than 20 U.S. states and territories. \n~Advancing sustainability through research. We leverage our research capabilities to advance sustainability and ESG investment strategies. In 2019, our firm published approximately 115 reports assessing the macro- and sector-level impact of climate change and outlining different approaches to integrating ESG into investment strategies. In addition, through J.P. Morgan ESG (JESG)—a suite of indices we launched in 2018 that integrate ESG factors into a composite benchmark—we provide scoring coverage for over 4,500 global corporate issuers across 14 sectors and nearly 300 sovereigns and quasi-sovereigns. The ESGQ quantitative metric for stock selection helps investors pick stocks that prioritize ESG factors and covers a universe of 5,124 stocks globally. In 2020, J.P. Morgan expanded its dedicated ESG research capabilities, adding ESG specialists in both our Equity Research and Global Index Research groups.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 29INVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCESERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITY\nAsset & Wealth Management\nSustainable investing is a priority within our AWM business, which \nhas $2.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and works with institutional, wholesale and professional clients around the world to invest capital to achieve their financial goals. \nOur Asset Management business believes that incorporation of \nmaterial ESG issues into the investment process can help to deliver enhanced risk-adjusted returns over the long term and it has committed to integrate ESG factors across all eligible strategies. Building on ESG integration, we also provide a range of dedicated sustainable investing products that aim to deliver financial returns, align portfolios with client values and help meet a diverse set of goals. As of year-end 2019, our Asset Management business had more than $1.3 trillion of AUM in ESG-integrated strategies and $2.4 billion in our suite of 11 dedicated sustainable investing products.  \nAs a fiduciary of our clients’ assets, we are committed to making \nsure that the companies in which we invest focus on responsible allocation of capital and long-term value creation with an investment-led, expert-driven investment stewardship approach. Our Asset Management business supports and participates in industry advocacy efforts aimed at addressing climate change, such as the TCFD and the United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) initiative. And, in 2020, Asset Management joined the Climate Action 100+ investor initiative to enhance its engagement with companies on climate-related risks and opportunities.  \nOur Wealth Management business is also working to expand and \nenhance how we help clients who want to pursue sustainable investing within their portfolios. Through white papers and other resources, we support our clients’ interests and share insights on sustainability topics such as sustainable agriculture, circular economy, electric vehicles and clean energy. \nAcross equities, fixed income, alternatives and multi-asset portfolios, \nWealth Management has 80 investment strategies globally geared toward sustainable investing, with $7.3 billion in AUM as of year-end 2019. These strategies span multiple approaches, including ESG integration, exclusionary screening, thematic investing and impact investing. We continue to develop tools to help clients achieve their sustainable investing goals and new opportunities for our clients to participate in impact investing funds. For example, in 2019 we offered a new investment opportunity to Wealth Management clients through RRG Capital Management, which is an impact-focused fund manager that—in partnership with The Nature Conservancy as a technical advisor—raised a fund that aims to invest across multiple synergistic themes such as water, farm acquisition and development, habitat conservation and renewable energy and storage. Expanding Our Firm’s Capacity  \nand Capabilities\nTo support JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to advance the SDGs and meet growing client demand, we are expanding our firm’s capacity and capabilities in emerging markets. In 2020, we launched the J.P. Morgan Development Finance Institution (JPM DFI), which is focused on scaling up financing for developing countries. In consultation with leading development institutions, JPM DFI has created a methodology intended to identify and qualify business activities and opportunities that generate both financial and developmental returns.\nOur CIB business has established an ESG Solutions group \nto advise our clients on a variety of ESG and climate-related topics. By bringing together specialists in sustainability and financial markets, this group will serve as a center of expertise to help our clients navigate the energy transition and respond to increased interest in ESG investing. The group will also lead the development of our sustainable product offerings, enabling our clients to improve their sustainability credentials and access ESG-focused capital. In addition, we have assembled a new Energy Transition Team to provide strategic and financial advice to corporate clients on mergers and acquisitions that support carbon optimization objectives.\nFinally, we have also established a Client Engagement \nteam focused on driving high-impact conversations on corporate responsibility and ESG-related topics with clients across our lines of business. \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 30INVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCESERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITY\nManaging Risk\nAssessing our clients’ approach to, and performance on, \nenvironmental and social matters is an important component of the firm’s risk management process. It helps us make more informed decisions and safeguards our reputation. It also enables us to offer our clients information and guidance on best practices when they are seeking to access capital markets, provide disclosures or improve sustainability practices. \nThe firm’s publicly available Environmental and Social Policy \nFramework (Framework) provides an overview of our approach to evaluating risks posed by environmental and social matters, including certain activities that we will not finance, and sectors and activities subject to environmental and social due diligence. In 2020, we updated our Framework to expand restrictions on financing for coal mining and coal-fired power and to prohibit project financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic. \nOur due diligence efforts are led by a dedicated environmental \nand social risk management group. In 2019, approximately 2,100 transactions were referred to this team for review because a potential environmental or social risk was identified. These included loans, debt underwriting, equity underwriting and advisory services. Detailed due diligence was undertaken on roughly one-third of the referred transactions. \nJPMorgan Chase participates in or has adopted various \ninternationally recognized principles that help guide our efforts on environmental and social risk management, including the Equator Principles. Further information about our implementation of the Equator Principles and other principles is available in our Framework . \nExpanding Our Focus on Climate Change\nIn 2019, we published our first climate report that was guided by recommendations of the TCFD. Our firm has served as a member of TCFD since it was established. Our report discusses our approach toward managing climate-related risks and how we are capitalizing on the opportunities that arise through a transition to a lower-carbon economy. Since our report was published, we have taken a number of steps to integrate climate factors into our firmwide processes for identifying, assessing and managing risks. For example:\n~We created a dedicated risk team focused on climate.\n~We integrated climate-related risks into the processes the firm \nuses to identify, assess and review the most material risks to our business.~We are evaluating stress testing approaches to deepen our understanding of the relationship between climate change and financial impact to our firm.\n~We continue to engage on policy through industry forums, such as the Climate Financial Risk Forum—established by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) of the Bank of England—as a member of the Scenario Analysis working group.\nPolicy Engagement\nAddressing complex global challenges, including climate change, requires collaboration and collective action. We participate in a variety of initiatives focused on advancing sustainability within our industry and across the corporate sector broadly. As part of this, we share our expertise on issues at the nexus of finance and sustainability, and learn from other companies and organizations.\nIn early 2020, for example, JPMorgan Chase joined the Climate \nLeadership Council (CLC), a think tank that is promoting a bipartisan roadmap for a revenue-neutral carbon tax and dividend framework for the U.S. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase play an important role financing the energy transition necessary to address climate change, and we believe the CLC’s roadmap is a step toward advancing a bipartisan conversation about concrete policy solutions. \nTransparency and \nReporting\nJPMorgan Chase is committed to providing stakeholders with \ninformation about our approach to and performance on ESG topics. This annual ESG Report, which summarizes our work on key issues, is one of the primary ways we do that. For the first time, this ESG Report is informed by SASB and includes a separate index, available on our website , which maps our firm’s disclosures against \nthe SASB indicators relevant to the sectors in which our firm operates. Our ESG Report also continues to be informed by GRI.    \nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 31INVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCESERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITY\nStrengthening Community Resilience to Climate Change  \nAround the world, communities are struggling to manage the impacts of natural disasters, such as severe weather and wildfires, \nmany of which could be exacerbated by climate change. These events are expected to grow over time—and to disproportionately impact the most vulnerable populations. While our firm has a robust operational resilience program and a long track record of supporting customers and communities after disaster strikes, we are taking an increasingly coordinated approach to helping communities prepare to withstand these threats.\nIn 2019, we launched community resilience pilots in South Florida and Northern California. Informed by community input about the \nmain challenges in responding to disasters, our firm committed nearly $3 million in philanthropic capital to help these communities develop new informational tools, models of engagement and research that will help prepare them to be more resilient in the face of the next disaster. Going forward, we are applying insights from these pilots to enhance our support. This includes working to expand our efforts to more communities that are vulnerable, as well as better aligning our community resilience strategy with immediate disaster relief efforts.\nOperational Sustainability\nMinimizing the environmental impact of our physical operations continues to be an important part of our global sustainability strategy. It also helps us to reduce costs and strengthen the firm’s resilience. Given the nature of our business, our direct environmental impacts stem primarily from the operation of more than 5,400 corporate buildings, retail bank branches and data centers, including the electricity needed to power those sites.\nIncreasing Renewable Energy\nIncreasing our support for renewable energy is a core part of our operational sustainability strategy. In addition to reducing energy consumption by implementing energy-efficient lighting and other technologies, we are undertaking a range of actions, including: \n~Installing on-site renewable energy at retail branches and \ncommer\ncial buildings;\n~Executing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and green pow \ner supply contracts to support the development of new \nrenewable energy projects on grids from which we purchase energy; and\n~Purchasing Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to green our elec tricit\ny supply.We will meet our 100% renewable energy commitment in 2020 by generating and purchasing energy and corresponding RECs in an amount equivalent to the total megawatt (MW) hours of electricity that JPMorgan Chase consumes globally over the year. The RECs we purchase will be sourced in accordance with RE100—an initiative of The Climate Group and CDP to accelerate the world’s transition to renewables—of which JPMorgan Chase is a member. Over time, our goal is to meet our commitment on an annual basis in a way that maximizes impact by bringing more renewable energy onto the grid.\nJPMORGAN CHASE & CO. Environmental Social & Governance Report 32INVESTING IN  \nOUR EMPLOYEESPROMOTING SOUND \nGOVERNANCESERVING OUR CUSTOMERSSUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES INTRODUCTION\nADVANCINGSUSTAINABILITY\nHighlights of our progress in 2019 include: \n~Completing LED lighting retrofits at 4,300 branches and 50 \ncommercial offices, which will result in up to 50% reduction in lighting energy consumption for each building;\n~Installing energy-efficient building management systems at 2,600 branches;  \n~Purchasing the equivalent of more than 10% of our global annual electricity consumption from a 100.5 MW wind farm in Texas and over 15% of the electricity we consume annually in India through a solar PPA in Bangalore;\n~Completing on-site solar installations at commercial offices, including the construction of a 3.6 MW rooftop and carport system in Arizona and a 2.8 MW rooftop system at our Polaris campus in Ohio, which is one of the world’s largest commercial installations of bifacial solar modules; and\n~Constructing rooftop solar systems at approximately 200 branches in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, which are on track to be completed in 2020. \nOffsetting Emissions from \nEmployee Travel  \nIn 2019, we offset 100% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nfrom employee air and rail travel.3 We achieved this by purchasing \n189,327 Verified Emission Reduction (VER) credits from forest management projects in the U.S., such as Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania. This project is part of Working Woodlands, a program designed by Bluesource and The Nature Conservancy to protect and sustainably manage forested lands for the benefit of the environment and local communities. In addition to sequestering an estimated 47,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) each year, Hawk Mountain Sanctuary includes 2,500 protected acres and provides habitat for more than 16 species of large birds of prey, including bald eagles, peregrine falcons and ospreys. \n3Includes client air and rail travel paid for by JPMorgan Chase.Key Memberships and Commitments\nJPMorgan Chase participates in, is a member of or has committed to various initiatives and principles that address business and sustainability matters, including:\n~Asian Corporate Governance Association (ACGA)\n~Business and Sustainable Development Commission \n~CDP (Investor Signatory)\n~Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) Business \nEnvironmental Leadership Council \n~Ceres\n~Climate Action 100+\n~Climate Leadership Council\n~Corporate Eco Forum\n~Equator Principles \n~Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative\n~Global Impact Investing Network\n~Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) \n~Green Bond Principles \n~Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change\n~RE100 \n~Soft Commodities Compact \n~U.N.

OUR THREE BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n5 MORGAN STANLEYIt has been an extremely challenging few months thus far in 2020. We are in  \nthe midst of a global health crisis, and a period of great economic uncertainty.  \nDuring this difficult time, the resilience of our team is more important than ever.  \nI am proud that our employees are doing what they do best: supporting our  \nclients and our firm, and helping their loved ones and communities through the  \nphysical and mental stress of this crisis. I know that together we can support  \none another in navigating these challenges. \nWhile it’s only April 2020, the year of 2019 feels very distant. Looking back, throughout 2019, sustainable investing gained \nmomentum. Mainstream investment managers and large corporations stepped forward with bold statements and long-term \ncommitments. 2019 ended with Time Magazine naming a young climate activist as its person of the year. 2020 kicked off with \nclimate change and sustainable investing as central themes at Davos.\nWhen the global pandemic hit, we turned our energy toward taking care of our employees, our clients and our communities. It is a \nchallenging time unlike any we have seen, but as a firm we are strong, and we will come through this. When we do, our commitment \nto our communities for a more sustainable world will be more important than ever. \nAs I reflect on what we achieved in 2019, I am reassured that the fundamentals of Morgan Stanley’s business strategy continue to \nprioritize long-term value creation, earnings stability and a strong, inclusive and ethical culture. This approach is core to everything \nwe do, including our efforts built over the past decade to integrate sustainability considerations across our firm. \nNotably, we became the first bank to embark on activities across the value chain to reduce plastic waste, announcing the \nMorgan Stanley Plastic Waste Resolution  in April 2019. While we benefit from the innovative products and services that plastics \nenable throughout our lives, including vital diagnostic and medical equipment, excessive plastic waste takes an environmental and \neconomic toll. By partnering with our clients as well as nonprofits and academic institutions, we have pledged to facilitate the \nprevention, reduction and removal of 50 million metric tons of plastic waste by 2030. This commitment maintains that plastic can \noffer many important benefits, while also seeking to reduce plastic waste from entering the natural environment and ecosystems.\nIn 2019, we hosted our inaugural Sustainable Investing Summit. The successful event, which was attended by more than 100 clients, \ndemonstrated our truly integrated approach and commitment to sustainability. Every day our professionals are focused on bringing \ntangible impacts to our sustainable investing initiatives, which include everything from issuing green bonds in capital markets, to \nimpact investing for Wealth Management clients, to innovative Investment Management strategies.\nThe risks and opportunities of climate change have become more apparent. We believe having a sustainable planet is foundational \nto having a healthy society and sound financial system. Morgan Stanley seeks to support the transition to a low-carbon economy \nthrough products and services, business activities, and actionable analysis for investors. Last year, we financed over $50 billion \ntoward our goal of $250 billion to support climate-related solutions by 2030. \nOn this journey we remain committed to providing investors with useful, relevant and meaningful sustainability information. \nMorgan Stanley is a longtime supporter of the Sustainability  Accounting Standards Board  (SASB). SASB’s guidance for Investment \nBanking, Commercial Banking and Asset Management help inform the content, narrative and data included in this report. In 2020,  \nwe will publish our first report in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures .\nAs we move forward in 2020, we expect to continue to advance our sustainability goals. We expect the markets to remain volatile \nthis year, but we look forward to a period of recovery in the coming years. Like you, I hope that recovery across financial services \nincorporates and advances the agenda we share to create a more sustainable and resilient future.\nJames P.

Led by our Vice Chairman, it  \nmeets regularly to track progress on  \nMorgan Stanley-led green, social and  \nsustainability deals; discuss structuring  \ntrends; and position our franchise in  \nthis growing market.DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS \nIn October 2019, Morgan Stanley was chosen to join the newly \nestablished Green Bond Principles (GBP) and Social Bond \nPrinciples (SBP) advisory council. The advisory council, composed \nof issuers, investors, underwriters and observers, will provide \nexpertise to the GBP/SBP Executive Committee and help \ndisseminate best practices in the market.\nIn the past year, we focused on driving capital toward the SDGs \nby leading large-scale and first-of-their-kind environmental, \nsocial and sustainability transactions. Through these efforts, we \nhave helped issuers obtain recognition for supporting ambitious \nsustainability and low-carbon transition plans that contribute to \nseveral SDGs. In line with the firm’s Plastic Waste Resolution,  \nour teams have led innovative, SDG-related transactions that \npromote sustainable plastics and packaging solutions, the circular \neconomy, and marine biodiversity, as well as economies that rely \non healthy and sustainable fisheries. Many of these are featured in  \nthe Sustainable Finance Transactions Highlights on pages 16 and 17 . \nFinancing for low-carbon solutions that advance SDG 7 and  \nSDG 13 also remains a priority. All green bonds we led in the past \nyear included decarbonization and/or clean-energy initiatives as \npart of their use of proceeds. In the U.S. municipal bond market \nspecifically, we continued to fund infrastructure projects that \nbrought environmental and social benefits to communities \naround the country, including mass  \ntransit, climate resiliency, affordable  \nwater and wastewater infrastructure,  \neducation facilities and community  \ndevelopment finance projects.Morgan Stanley was named Lead Manager  \nof the Year 2019 for U.S. Municipal Green Bonds  \nby Environmental Finance.\n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT19\nMORGAN STANLEYSustainability Research  \nWhen investors take sustainability considerations into account \nin their financial decision-making, the cumulative effect can \nmake a difference across the global economy. To support ESG \nintegration, Morgan Stanley analysts use a sustainability lens \nto conduct investment research on each sector and company \nour businesses advise on. This effort is led by our Sustainability \nResearch team, part of Institutional Securities’ Research \nDivision. To provide useful and actionable information to our \nclients, we: \n•  Develop stock-specific summaries on material ESG factors.  \nThese insights vary by sector and company, and focus on \nmaterial ESG topics characterized as “explicit” (likely to \ndirectly impact financial performance), “implicit” (essential \nto business health but cannot always be quantified) or both. \nIn 2019, the Research Division launched a new “ESG Matters” \nhome page of company summaries and thematic sustainability \nresearch reports on topics such as climate change and \nsustainable consumption.\n•   Publish analysis on market-relevant ESG themes, risks \nand opportunities.  Topical examples from 2019 include \nresearch on de-carbonization technologies, physical climate \nrisk and gender diversity. De-carbonization: The Race to Zero \nEmissions  analyzed the roles and investment needs of five \ntechnologies—renewables, electric vehicles, carbon capture, \nbiofuels and hydrogen—in achieving the two-degree Celsius \nwarming scenario envisaged by the Paris Agreement. With \nour quantitative research team, Sustainability Research also \nintroduced the Holistic Equal Representation Score (HERS)  \nto gauge corporate gender diversity.\n•  Leverage our expertise and data to support thematic and \nimpact investing approaches.  In 2019, we updated our \nSustainable Solutions interactive database used by investors \nto gauge a company’s alignment to specific sustainability \nissues. The team also launched a new interactive tool that \nidentifies over 600 companies aligned to one or more \nof the SDGs.\nMorgan Stanley’s Sustainability Research team has \nbeen regularly ranked in the top three firms for SRI and \nSustainability sell-side research  by the Extel survey  \nof European equities and the U.K. Sustainable  \nInvestment and Finance Association.SALES AND TRADING \nMorgan Stanley’s equity franchise is seeing increased \nintegration of ESG insights and products into execution and \nstrategic partnership across equity and fixed income products. \nIn 2019, Morgan Stanley Global Sales put together a list of \nhigh conviction sustainability ideas. The ideas, diversified across \nsectors and geographies and sourced from Morgan Stanley \nEquity Research, relate to one of five sustainability themes: \nclimate change, resource management, health & wellbeing, \nsafety & security, inclusion.  \nCommodities \nMorgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (MSCGI) supports renewable \nenergy deployment across the United States by providing \nofftake agreements and hedging products for new and \noperating wind farms and solar installations. These transactions \nensure stable cash flows for developers to complete financing \nand construction. In 2019, MSCGI provided long-term hedging \ntransactions across Texas and the Midwest totaling 726 MW for \nnew build renewable projects and nearly 676 MW for existing \nrenewable projects. \nFINANCING AND ADVISORY SERVICES \nIn response to client interest in ESG issues, our Investing \nBanking Division (IBD) teams increasingly advise clients and \nmobilize capital to support sustainability-focused clean \ntechnology and renewable energy businesses. Our industry, \nregional and country teams provide tailored services to \ncorporations, financial institutions and government clients \nlooking to execute innovative solutions to address sustainability \nchallenges and meet sustainability goals. In 2019, our ESG-\nfocused advisory services were further expanded against a \nbackdrop of regulatory change. To maximize our expertise, \nIBD works in close collaboration with GSF and Global \nCapital Markets.Bank of England Shares Insights at Inaugural \nSustainable Investing Conference  \nNearly 200 clients attended our Institutional Equities Division’s \nfirst sustainable investing conference in Morgan Stanley’s London \noffice in September 2019. The event featured keynote addresses \nfrom senior leaders at the firm, insights from a Bank of England \nrepresentative and panel discussions with institutional investors and \nESG data providers. Topics included the business and moral cases \nfor ESG integration, the need for better ESG data (particularly \nclimate-related) and the role of policy in driving change.\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT20\nMORGAN STANLEYWealth Management\nIndividuals, families and institutions are seeking to make a \npositive difference in the world with their capital.

A core component \nof the application is multidimensional impact reporting on how \ninvestments align with a client’s unique impact objectives at \nthe portfolio, investment strategy and security levels. It also \nprovides a framework for clients to identify and prioritize over \n100 social and environmental impact preferences and guidance \nfor Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors in matching investment \nportfolios with the issues their clients care about most.\nSupplementing traditional financial reporting and analysis, \nMorgan Stanley IQ covers three impact dimensions:\n ALIGNMENT\nBy highlighting potential investments across a \nwide range of issues, such as companies working \nto reduce their carbon footprint or make gender \ndiversity a priority.\n EXPOSURE\nBy spotlighting sectors, issues or companies \nwith a track record of behaviors a client may \nseek to avoid such as human rights violations or \ninvolvement in the sale of tobacco or firearms.\nACTIVATION\nBy assessing the percentage of investments  \nwith an explicit focus on integrating restriction \nscreening, environmental, social or governance \ndata, and thematic or impact objectives into the \ninvestment process. Further, we show alignment \nto global frameworks such as the UN SDGs. Partnering with the Financial Health Network  \nIn 2019, Morgan Stanley further developed our relationship with \nthe Financial Health Network, a nationally recognized nonprofit \nwith a mission to improve financial health for all. Morgan Stanley \nWealth Management’s Corporate and Institutional Solutions and \nGSF teams partnered with the Financial Health Network to survey \ncorporate employees across the U.S. to better understand the \ndrivers of workplace financial stress and the range of financial \nwellness benefits employees seek most. Results indicate that \nfinances are employees’ greatest source of stress, with half of \nrespondents spending equal to or more than they earn each month, \nand 41% lacking savings to cover 3 months of expenses. Informed \nby these insights, we have started to expand the financial wellness \nofferings through our Corporate and Institutional Solutions \nbusiness, including student loan refinancing from Credible, financial \ncoaching through MySecure Advantage and an enhanced digital \nportal experience. With a growing base of corporate clients \nserved through Shareworks  by Morgan Stanley, we have a greater \nopportunity to positively influence the financial wellness of  \nmillions of employees globally. A summary of our most recent \nfindings have been published in a series of white papers  with the \nFinancial Health Network.Over 300 Wealth Management Financial Advisors across the \ncountry participated in the year-long pilot leading up to the launch \nof Morgan Stanley IQ.

The \nportfolios aim to contribute to Morgan Stanley’s Plastic Waste \nResolution (see more on page 10 ), by employing investment \nmanagers that target several SDGs, in particular, SDG 13 and \nSDG 14, which focuses on ocean conservation.EQUIPPING FINANCIAL ADVISORS\nAn important focus for IIP is ensuring that our nearly 15,500 \nFinancial Advisors, Private Wealth Advisors, International \nClient Advisors and Institutional Consultants have access to the \ntools and resources necessary to better serve clients seeking \nto meet their financial and impact goals. In 2019, the IIP team \nhosted 11 educational roadshows across a range of thematic \ntopics including climate, gender, faith and community investing. \nTo encourage excellence and leadership among our Financial \nAdvisors, we introduced the IIP Director designation in 2018 \nand continued to enhance its requirements and related learning \nopportunities in 2019. We ended the year with 49 IIP Directors.Addressing Client Demand for Thematic Toolkits   \nIn October 2019, IIP launched a first-of-its kind Jewish Values  \nTool Kit in collaboration with the Philanthropy Management \nteam. The tool kit provides our Financial Advisors with access  \nto educational materials and investment and grant-making \nresources to implement their client’s unique  \nfinancial and faith-based goals. Leading up to  \nthe release, the team led a series of Jewish Values  \nConsortiums across the country, which brought together  \nmore than 250 Jewish philanthropy and community leaders.\nIIP updates thematic tool kits to reflect global sustainability \ntrends and investor demand.

Working with the Institute  \nand GSF, MSIM provides portfolio solutions that help clients \nmeet their environmental, social and governance goals.\nMSIM SUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL  \nMSIM takes a holistic approach to sustainable investing to \npromote long-term value for our business and clients. Our \ndifferentiated investment teams lead this process, with support \nfrom the MSIM Sustainability Council. An advisory forum, the \nCouncil convenes cross-functional leaders, including portfolio \nmanagers and investment analysts. Members share approaches \nto sustainable investing, product development, measurement, \neducation, client engagement and reporting. The Council \nis supported by MSIM’s Global Stewardship team, which is \ncomprised of sustainabale investing professionals who facilitate \nproxy voting and collaborate with our investment teams on \ncompany engagements and sustainable investing activities.  \nThe Council is also supported by GSF and the Institute. \nIn 2019, the Council surveyed best practices for sustainable \ninvesting, facilitated third-party sustainable investing  \ntraining for investors and promoted greater alignment across \nMSIM’s strategies that apply sustainable investing approaches.  \nTo make our sustainability solutions more accessible for  \nclients, we launched a new web page , Sustainability Insights, \nand published our PRI Transparency Report . \nIn 2020, the Council’s priorities include exploring how to \nenhance our sustainability reporting and approach to climate \nchange, drawing on the recommendations of the TCFD.Investment ManagementBY THE NUMBERS\n>600\nIn 2019, MSIM engaged with more than  \n600 companies on sustainability issues ranging  \nfrom climate risk and diversity to inclusion  \nand plastic waste reduction.\nGLOBAL STEWARDSHIP TEAM\nProxy voting, company engagement and ESG researchActive  \nFundamental  \nEquityGlobal  \nFixed  \nIncomeGlobal  \nLiquiditySolutions  \nand  \nMulti-AssetReal  \nAssetsPrivate  \nCredit and  \nEquitySUSTAINABILITY COUNCIL\nSenior level, cross-functional business leader, portfolio managers  \nand investment analysts setting strategy and process\nMORGAN STANLEY  \nINSTITUTE FOR \nSUSTAINABLE  \nINVESTINGESG Governance Structrue * Defined as long-term assets under management (excludes liquidity assets) \nmanaged according to at least one sustainable investing approach as of 12.31.19>75%\nof long-term client assets apply sustainable  \ninvesting approaches ( +$270bn ).\n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT23\nMORGAN STANLEYDRIVING SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH ENGAGEMENT  \nActive ownership is the hallmark of our approach and sets \nus apart from many peers. As long-term investors and active \nmanagers, we believe we have both a duty and an opportunity \nto act as stewards of the capital we manage. Our investment \nteams embrace this opportunity by engaging directly and \noften with their portfolio companies and by exercising proxy \nvoting rights. MSIM investment professionals attend company \npresentations, road shows, and conferences, and join analyst \ncalls. They also proactively engage in direct dialogue with \ncompany management and boards of directors in-person and \non the phone. These engagements drive our active ownership \nstrategy enabling us to guide portfolio companies toward \nbetter governance and sustainability practices, which we  \nbelieve enhance long-term returns. In addition to direct engagement carried out by our investment \nteams, MSIM’s Global Stewardship team also engages with \nportfolio companies on sustainability topics. The team \nengages with companies around annual general meetings, and \nthroughout the year on emerging material sustainability topics. \nFor a summary of our 2019 proxy voting history and ESG \nengagements, see our annual 2019 Global Stewardship Report .\nHelping Portfolio Companies Tackle Plastic Waste   \nIn support of Morgan Stanley’s new commitment to reduce plastic \nwaste, MSIM is engaging more with portfolio companies on this \ncritical topic.\nIn 2019, the International Equity  team met with 11 of its fast-moving \nconsumer goods sector (FMCG) holdings, including beverages, \nhousehold and personal care companies, to discuss plastic waste. \nWhile there is no single solution, the most practical near-term \nsolution for FMCG companies is increasing the proportion of \nrecycled content in their packaging and reducing the overall amount \nof packaging. Most of the team’s holdings with exposure to plastic \npackaging have now publicly committed to significantly increase \nrecycled content, from less than 10% in most cases to 20–50% by \n2025–30. Direct engagement helped inform the team’s research \nand analysis of whether this issue represents a material risk to the \nsustainability of returns on operating capital of its FMCG holdings. \nOur Counterpoint Global  team has convened corporate, academic \nand NGO experts to explore solutions to marine plastic waste. \nThrough this process, the team identified a global coffee retailer in \nits portfolio with disproportionate brand risk exposure. With our \nsupport, the company announced plans and targets to minimize its \nsingle-use-plastic footprint and collaborate with competitors to \ncreate sustainable packaging. \n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT24\nMORGAN STANLEYESG INTEGRATION IN ACTION: FIXED INCOME ESG CREDIT \nSCORING FRAMEWORK\nThe MSIM Fixed Income team has established a unique scoring \nmodel for evaluating ESG factors in corporate credit. ESG \nresearch is not typically designed for fixed income investors. \nAs a result, the MSIM fixed income team created a proprietary \nESG-scoring methodology that explicitly considers the risks \nand opportunities ESG factors pose to corporate bonds. Built \non deep knowledge as sector specialists, the credit analysts \ncomplement their investment expertise with ESG-focused \nresearch from an array of leading third-party sources to derive \nsector risk weightings across 47 sub-sectors. The team’s view \nis that companies should be rewarded for demonstrating a \nwillingness to change and adopt stronger ESG principles. To \naccount for momentum in the scoring methodology, the team \nmakes numerical adjustments to third-party data in favor of \ncompanies that demonstrate positive ESG momentum and \nagainst companies that demonstrate negative momentum.  \nA similar adjustment is made for ESG-related controversies.  \nThe resulting blended score provides a meaningful input for \nfixed income investors, allows for comparison across sectors \nand measures long-term risk. In 2019, the model was integrated \ninto the fundamental investment analysis framework for all \ncorporate credit research across MSIM.\nCOMPANY ENGAGEMENT\nSeeking to drive improvement in ESG activities or outcomes through proxy voting and/or active dialogue with invested companiesRESTRICTION  \nSCREENING\nIntentionally avoiding \ninvestments in certain \nsectors or issuers based  \non values or risk-\nbased criteriaESG INTEGRATION\nConsidering ESG criteria \nalongside financial  \nanalysis to identify \nrisks and opportunities \nthroughout the  \ninvestment process,  \nwhich may lead to \ndecisions to avoid,  \ninclude or size certain \ninvestmentsTHEMATIC \nINVESTMENTS\nTilting investments  \ntoward certain themes \nand sectors positioned to \nsolve global sustainability-\nrelated challenges, \nincludes ‘Sustainable \nFunds’ as defined by \nEU Taxonomy or other \nregulatory frameworksIMPACT INVESTING\nAllocating to funds or \nenterprises intentionally \nstructured to deliver a \nspecific and measurable \nset of positive social and/\nor environmental impacts \nalongside market-rate \nfinancial returnsSUSTAINABLE INVESTING APPROACHESBUILDING ESG INTO CLIENT PORTFOLIOS  \nSustainable Investing at MSIM is investor-led with each \ninvestment team setting its own differentiated approach for  \nincorporating sustainability factors into the investment  \nprocess.

The new ESG Income \nstrategy excludes entities on the Carbon Underground 200 as \nwell as corporations that derive revenue from landmines and \ncluster munitions, firearms, thermal coal or coal-fired power \ngeneration and tobacco. It integrates ESG as follows: \n•  Corporate Credit:  Proprietary ESG scoring model that  \napplies ESG controversy and momentum tilts and sector  \nrisk overlays. \n•  Sovereign:  Embeds issues such as press freedom, political \nand social stability, environmental concerns, corruption, and \nrule of law into the team’s fundamental country analysis \nframework.\n•  Securitized:  Proprietary rating system scores each security \non ESG factors such as the environmental impact of \nunderlying loans or assets and the extent to which they \npromote financial inclusion and fair lending practices. Inform in Action: Thought Leadership on  \nClimate Risk and Opportunity \nIn 2019, MSIM investment teams deepened their focus on climate \nrisk and how it impacts investing. \nFor example, the AIP Private Markets business authored  \nDebunking Six Myths About Climate Investing . The paper \nidentified the investable opportunity to address climate change \nas much broader than renewable energy and clean tech. AIP’s \nPrivate Markets business demonstrates this in practice by creating \nmeasurable climate solutions across multiple sectors—energy, \nfood, agriculture and chemicals. The team’s investments also  \nalign with the SDGs. \nSeparate research published by the Global Balanced Risk \nControl Strategy team highlighted Three Climate Tipping Points \nShaping Markets . The analysis demonstrated how government \nand regulatory intervention is imminent, climate inaction is \nundermining social stability and the dropping cost of renewable \nenergy makes it harder for markets to ignore  \nthe benefits of low-carbon transition.\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT26\nMORGAN STANLEY\nCommunity Development Finance\nMorgan Stanley also brings together investment and \nphilanthropic and private capital to create lasting positive \nchanges in communities across the United States. Our U.S. \nbanks have consistently received “Outstanding” ratings  \nfrom the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), \nincluding most recently in 2019, for their track records in \nmeeting community needs. \nOur Community Development Finance (CDF) group executes \nnew and innovative transactions not routinely provided by \nprivate investors. Designed and implemented with community \nand nonprofit partners, our program seeks to transform \npeople’s quality of life through a focus on:\n•  Preservation and development of sustainable, multifamily \naffordable rental housing\n•  Healthy communities \n•  Equitable transit-oriented development \n•  Economic development that supports quality jobs \n•  Capital for underserved, small and rural markets \n•  Capacity building for nonprofits.\nA summary of our nationwide impact through 2019 is shown  \non the right, alongside highlights of the year’s most innovative \nand impactful transactions.Community Development Finance  \n2010–2019\n116,000+  affordable housing units funded$21 billion\ncommitted in loans and investmentsBY THE NUMBERS\n140,000+  jobs created or retained$321 million  committed in small-business loans,  \nincluding $59 million in 2019 \n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT27\nMORGAN STANLEY2019 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCE HIGHLIGHTS\nKeeping Housing Affordable: Using \nthe tools of Wall Street, we work with \nmission-oriented affordable housing \npartners to acquire multifamily rental \nproperties at risk of converting to market \nrate and obtain permanent financing to \nkeep them affordable. Since 2014, when \nMorgan Stanley launched its private  \nequity funds to preserve affordable \nmultifamily rental housing, the firm has \ncommitted to invest $955MM in private \nequity funds that achieve this goal, \nincluding more than $500MM in 2019.\nConnecting Affordable Housing to \nTransit:  We support initiatives that  \nlower the cost burden of transportation \nfor low-income people and improve \npublic transit access, which in turn helps \nreduce dependence on cars.  In 2019, we \nhelped finance the Utah Equitable Transit \nOriented Development Fund, which will \ndevelop and acquire multifamily rental \nunits and for-sale housing located within \na half mile of transit sites in the fastest-\ngrowing state in the country.\nSupporting Community Health:   \nWe continued to invest in community \nhealth through the Healthy Futures Fund \n(HFF). Created in partnership with the \nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation \n(LISC) and The Kresge Foundation, \nMorgan Stanley provides capital through \nHFF to expand healthcare access by co-\nlocating quality primary care clinics and \naffordable housing. In 2019, we invested \n$18.5MM in Stanton Square, Washington, \nD.C., which will construct 121 affordable \nhomes alongside a Morgan Stanley \nfinanced community health center.Catalyzing Community Development \nFinance:  In 2019, we continued to  \ndrive change in the financing market \nfor Community Development Finance \nInstitutions (CDFIs). Specifically, \nMorgan Stanley structured and \nmarketed a groundbreaking $100 million \nsustainability bond issuance for the Low \nIncome Investment Fund (LIIF). The bond \nis a CDFI sector first, aligning directly  \nwith eight of the SDGs: SDG 1 , SDG 2 , \nSDG 3 , SDG4 , SDG 8 , SDG 9 , SDG 10  \nand SDG 11 .  LIIF was the fifth U.S. CDFI \nto issue debt through the public capital \nmarkets, with Morgan Stanley managing \nthree of these offerings, including the \nsector inaugural issuance in 2017.Funding Residents’ Services:  In 2019, \nwe committed to expand our unique \nfunding program for resident services \nin affordable housing properties \nnationally. This follows the success of a \npilot program related to our efforts to \nrenovate, and keep affordable, severely \ndistressed buildings in New York City. \nResidents of these properties, or their \nsurrounding communities, receive diverse \nservices that improve daily life. Examples \ninclude: a garden manager who helps \nresidents grow healthy foods, free \nfinancial and college counseling, aging-  \nin-place and wellness programs for \nseniors, and arts activities.\nResponding to Natural Disasters:   \nWhen extreme weather strikes, affordable \nhousing shortages can be exacerbated \nin affected towns and cities. We help \ncommunities rebuild after disasters, \nfocusing in 2019 on the aftermath of \nthe California wildfires. Our experts \nhelped lead taskforces of nonprofits and \nstakeholders in devastated communities. \nAs an example, in 2019, two of our \nfinancings helped create almost 80 \naffordable apartment units for low- and \nmoderate-income families in Sonoma \nCounty, at a time of extreme shortage.\n\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT28\nMORGAN STANLEYThe Institute for Sustainable \nInvesting   \nChaired by the firm’s CEO and Chairman, James Gorman, an \nadvisory board of prominent leaders from business, academia \nand leading nongovernmental organizations guides the  \nInstitute’s priorities.\nFostering Innovation\nAs part of GSF, the Institute partners across the firm, and with \noutside stakeholders, to pioneer scalable solutions and build \nnew sustainable investing tools and capabilities. \nWithin Morgan Stanley, the Institute provides insights and \nperspectives to the firm’s three businesses.

Institutional investors,  \nasset owners, corporate financial leaders and high net worth  \nindividual investors came together to discuss the innovation and  \nideas reshaping capital markets. The event featured speakers  \nfrom the Institute’s advisory board, Morgan Stanley’s Operating  \nCommittee, and financial and business leaders across public  \nand private markets.\nSustainable Signals: \nGrowth and Opportunity in Asset Management \nExecutive Summary\nSustainable investing has gone mainstream in the United States. A new survey \nreveals that asset managers now view sustainable investing as a strategic business \nimperative. Asset managers surveyed foresee a rosy outlook for both client \ndemand and competitive returns, and will continue to build their sustainable \ninvesting capabilities and product portfolios in the coming years.\nThis survey by the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing and Bloomberg highlights the growth, \ndirection and future outlook of sustainable investing among U.S. asset managers. It builds on a survey and \ninterview series first conducted in 2016. \nIn our 2018 survey …\n75% 89%\nof asset managers say  \ntheir firms have adopted  \nsustainable investing ,  \nup 10% from 2016.say their firms will  \ndevote additional resources  \nto sustainable investing  \nin the next 1–2 years.believe it’s possible to  \nmaximize financial returns  \nwhile investing  \nsustainably.62%\nPlastic is a valuable material that has contributed to global economic growth  \nsince the 1950s. It has helped transform sectors as wide-ranging as health care, \ntransportation, packaging and electronics. Over the last few years, however, the  \npublic has grown increasingly aware of the impact of plastic waste. Changing \nconsumer preferences and increased regulation are driving companies to better \nmeasure and manage their plastic footprints. Meanwhile, valuable raw materials \nworth billions of dollars are discarded each year due to inefficiencies in design, \ncollection and recycling of products containing plastic. While it remains a nascent \ninvestment theme, the ubiquity of plastic, and the growing trend to reduce the  \nimpact of plastic waste, warrants a closer look from the investment community.\nPlastics are durable, malleable, multifunctional materials  \nwith low-cost, high-volume production methods. These traits \nhave helped drive a massive increase in plastic use since \nproduction began in earnest following World War II. Primary \nplastic production has increased more than 20-fold since \nthe 1960s,1 to 407 million metric tons in 2015.2 Production has grown so quickly, in fact, that virtually half of all plastics \never produced were manufactured within the last 15 years.3 \nAs populations grow, poverty rates decline and consumption \nrates increase—particularly in emerging economies—plastic \nproduction is forecast to outpace global economic growth by  \na multiplier of 1.2 to 1.5.4Plastic Waste:  \nAddressing a Global Economic and Environmental \nChallenge Through the Power of the Capital Markets\nSustainable Signals: Growth and \nOpportunity in Asset Management  \nprovided the latest data on the continued \ngrowth of sustainable investing among  \nU.S .asset managers, with 75% of firms  \nnow practicing sustainable investing.Plastic Waste: Addressing a Global \nEconomic and Environmental Challenge \nThrough the Power of the Capital Markets  \nhighlighted the groundswell of interest in \nand investment considerations for plastic \nwaste as a nascent investment theme.\nSustainable Reality: Analyzing Risk and \nReturns of Sustainable Funds  examined the \nperformance of 10,723 funds. It found that \nthere is no financial trade-off between the \nreturns of sustainable funds and traditional \nfunds, and that sustainable funds may  \noffer lower market risk.\nIn April 2019, Morgan Stanley became the first financial \nservices firm to commit to developing systemic solutions \nto help address the growing challenge of plastic waste. \nThrough the speed, scale and innovation of the capital \nmarkets, and by partnering with our clients, employees and  \nnon-profits, the Morgan Stanley Plastic Waste Resolution \naims to prevent, reduce and remove 50 million metric tons \nof plastic waste from entering rivers, oceans, landscapes \nand landfills by 2030.\nAs investors show growing interest in committing capital to solve \nenvironmental challenges, blue bonds have emerged as the latest financing \ninstrument to help protect the world’s oceans and the economies that \nrely on their health. Navindu Katugampola, Head of Green, Social and \nSustainability Bonds at Morgan Stanley’s Global Capital Markets, spoke with \nMatthew Slovik, Head of Global Sustainable Finance, to explain this new \ncredit asset and how it can further boost sustainable investing.Blue Bonds:  \nThe Next Wave of Sustainable Bonds\nThe Morgan Stanley Plastic Waste \nResolution  aims to prevent, reduce \nand remove 50 million metric tons \nof plastic waste from entering \nrivers, oceans, landscapes and \nlandfills by 2030.50 million metric tons\nSustainable Signals: \nIndividual Investor Interest Driven by Impact, Conviction \nand Choice\nExecutive Summary\nSustainable investing continues to make gains. Investor familiarity and enthusiasm \nis at an all-time high. More than 8 in 10 U.S. individual investors (85%) now express \ninterest in sustainable investing, while half take part in at least one sustainable \ninvesting activity. As the market matures, reaching $12 trillion in the United States \nalone,1 individual investors are also driving innovation. Increasingly proactive, they \nseek products and solutions across asset classes tailored to their interests. They also \nwant to measure the environmental and social impact of their investments. \nThese are among the key findings of Morgan Stanley’s third Sustainable Signals \nsurvey of individual investors, which reinforces a picture of a field coming into its \nown since 2015. \nAmong individual investors:\n85%\nare interested in  \nsustainable investing ,  \nup 10 percentage  \npoints from 2017.of Millennials are  \ninterested in sustainable \ninvesting , up 9 percentage  \npoints from 2017.95%\nBlue Bonds: The Next Wave of  \nSustainable Bonds  explored water-  \nrelated bonds as an emerging debt \ninstrument to help issuers raise  \ncapital for marine and ocean health.Sustainable Signals: Individual Investor \nInterest Driven by Impact Conviction  \nand Choice  found that 85% of individual \ninvestors are interested in sustainable \ninvesting, up from 71% in 2015.

These programs expose tomorrow’s financial \nservices executives to the power of capital market solutions  \nto address sustainability challenges early in their careers. \nOur two hallmark programs are the Sustainable Investing \nFellowship and the Sustainable Investing Challenge. \nThe fellowship places graduate students in sustainability \nfunctions across the firm in our global headquarters in New \nYork City and in our London Office. In 2019, nearly 1,500 \nstudents applied for five positions. The selected candidates \nwere placed in GSF, Global Capital Markets, Wealth \nManagement and Investment Management.\nIn April 2019, we hosted the ninth annual Kellogg-  \nMorgan Stanley Sustainable Investing Challenge in Hong  \nKong. This highly competitive event (see Snapshot) invites \ngraduate students worldwide to develop financial solutions \nto social and environmental challenges that can also achieve \nmarket-rate financial returns.Carbon Yield Fund Wins 2019 Student Challenge \nThe winning proposal in our Sustainable Investing Challenge  \nseeks to reduce agriculture’s carbon footprint. A team from \nNorthwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management \ndeveloped a financial instrument to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by expanding regenerative practices for grain farmers  \nin the U.S. Midwest. The fund would first provide loans to  \nfarmers to support the organic certification process and then \nmonetize emission reductions associated with regenerative  \norganic agriculture through carbon offsets.\nPROPOSED  \nPROJECTS IN\n31\nCOUNTRIES\nFROM\n80\nSCHOOLS\nFROM\n50\nHOME COUNTRIES \nTOTAL OF\n365\nSTUDENTS\nFORMING\n109\nTEAMS\nNARROWED TO\n12\nFINALISTS2019 KELLOGG-MORGAN STANLEY SUSTAINABLE INVESTING CHALLENGE COMPETITION SNAPSHOT\n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT31\nMORGAN STANLEYFirmwide Sustainability \nMorgan Stanley seeks to lead on sustainability in the financial services sector by reducing  \nthe environmental impact of our operations, committing to carbon neutrality, engaging and \nsupporting a diverse employee base, and practicing strong governance. Our leadership,  \nemployees and stakeholders work together to drive firmwide sustainability efforts to support  \na healthier planet, a more inclusive economy and workplace, and the highest ethical standards.\nGovernance and Business Ethics\nAs a global financial institution, our reputation is our most \nimportant asset. For decades, Morgan Stanley’s strong \ngovernance and reputation for integrity have provided a \nfoundation for success, helping reduce risk to our business and \nenhancing value for our stakeholders. Our core values underpin \nthis culture, support our sustainability strategy and drive \neverything we do. By Doing the Right Thing, Putting Clients \nFirst, Leading With Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back, we  \nseek to meet client needs, deliver value for investors and \nsupport a sound and sustainable global financial system. LEADERSHIP FROM THE TOP \nMorgan Stanley is deeply committed to strong and ethical \ngovernance. This begins with our 14-member board of directors, \nof whom 11 are independent and four are women. Our directors \ncome from a range of backgrounds across the private sector, \ngovernment and public policy arenas, with a global perspective. \nTheir collective experience guiding large, complex organizations \nas executive leaders or board members brings a diversity of \nqualifications and skills applicable to guiding our business and \nlong-term strategy.\nTHE MORGAN STANLEY BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n Non- Management = 13\n  Management = 1Board Tenure Balance Board Independence\n  >8 years = 2\n  6–8 years = 3\n  3–6 years = 5\n <3 years = 4 5.4 years  \naverage tenure *\n* Average tenure of directors is calculated based on length of completed  \nBoard service from date of initial election through the date of the annual  \nmeeting and prior Board service, as appropriate.All Board committees are comprised of non-management directors,  \nand the Board benefits from an engaged Independent Lead Director  \nwith expansive responsibilities. 13 \nnon-management  \n members\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT32\nMORGAN STANLEYRESPONSIBLE COMPENSATION  \nMorgan Stanley is committed to responsible compensation \nprograms that support the firm’s strategy, culture and \nvalues over the long term. We pay incentive compensation \nbased on performance against financial and nonfinancial \ngoals set by the board of directors. Each year, the board \nand executive management team evaluate our strategy and \nrefine performance goals and priorities to help ensure long-\nterm benefit to our shareholders. The board Compensation, \nManagement Development and Succession (CMDS) Committee \nsets executive compensation at year end. In 2019, 75% of  \nour CEO’s incentive compensation was deferred over three  \nyears and subject to clawback; 100% of deferred incentive \ncompensation is delivered in equity awards and 50% \nof incentive compensation is delivered through future \nperformance-vested equity awards. \nExecutives with responsibility for sustainability, including but \nnot limited to the Vice Chairman, Chief Sustainability Officer \nand the Global Head of Corporate Services are evaluated \nagainst sustainability performance, goals and targets. \nShareholder feedback has led to various enhancements in \ncorporate governance, disclosure and compensation in recent \nyears. For more information, see page 9 of our 2020 Proxy \nStatement .\nETHICAL BUSINESS CONDUCT  \nMorgan Stanley is committed to best-in-class governance \npractices and the highest ethical standards. Our Code of \nConduct  and Code of Ethics and Business  guide the day-to-day \nbehavior of approximately 60,000 employees worldwide  \n(see also Our Culture ). \nFinancial crimes undermine public trust in our sector. We take \nall reasonable measures to prevent them, including mandatory \nawareness training for employees. Robust risk-based policies, \nprocedures and internal controls guard against misuse of our \nproducts and services for money laundering, terrorism, bribery \nor other criminal activity. All employees are required to report \nany legal or ethical concerns to a supervisor, our Human \nResources or Legal and Compliance teams, or an anonymous \nIntegrity Hotline operated by an independent vendor. We take \nallegations of misconduct seriously and prohibit any retaliation \nagainst anyone raising a concern in good faith. \nWe also expect our suppliers to meet our core values and \nhigh standards for doing business. Our Supplier Code of \nConduct  lays out our requirements for human and labor rights, \nenvironmental protections, and ethical business practice.Anti-Corruption and Bribery\nMorgan Stanley forbids all forms of bribery and corruption, \nand accordingly has implemented policies, procedures and \ninternal controls reasonably designed to comply with applicable \nanticorruption laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where \nwe operate. Our Global Anti-Corruption Policy is updated \nannually and lays out clear rules and guidelines designed to \nmitigate corruption risk. All Morgan Stanley employees must \ntake anti-corruption training at least annually, and we provide \nmore frequent, targeted training for relevant employees. In \naddition, we conduct periodic risk-based monitoring and testing \nto promote employee compliance with the Policy. For more \ninformation on our anti-corruption program, see our publicly \navailable Code of Conduct .\nCORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY \nMorgan Stanley’s publicly available Corporate Political Activities \nPolicy Statement , approved by the Board’s Nominating and \nGovernance Committee, sets out our policies on U.S. political \ncontributions, lobbying activities and trade association \nparticipation. In accordance with the policy, we prohibit corporate \ncontributions in the U.S. at the federal, state or local levels. \nRisk Management\nRisk is part of our everyday business and activities as a leading \nfinancial services institution. To protect our business, clients, \nshareholders and other stakeholders, we employ rigorous and \ncomprehensive risk management policies, controls and training.\nMorgan Stanley pursues risk-adjusted returns through prudent \nrisk-taking that protects our capital base and franchise. Five key \nprinciples underlie this philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, \nindependence, accountability and transparency. These principles \nare implemented firmwide through our Enterprise Risk \nManagement (ERM) framework and govern all risk management \nactions by employees. \nMorgan Stanley’s leadership prioritizes risk management \nworldwide, mandating thorough and frequent communication, \nthe appropriate escalation of risk issues, and ongoing review and \nenhancement of policies and processes. Our board of directors \nhas ultimate oversight of strategic risk as well as risks related to \nculture, values, conduct and reputation, and the ERM framework. \nFor more information on Risk Management, including Risk \nCommittee priorities, see our 2019 Form 10-K  and our 2020 \nProxy Statement .\n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT33\nMORGAN STANLEYENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (ESRM) \nIntegrating environmental and social risk into our business \nreview process is a priority and enables us to appropriately \nassess business opportunities. Management of environmental \nand social risks to our firm and clients is governed by our \nenvironmental and social risk management (ESRM)-related \npolicy statements, available on our Corporate Governance web \npage . Our ESRM group advises business units, assesses relevant \ntransactions and monitors emerging environmental and social \nissues. ESRM and GSF regularly engage external stakeholders \n(see also page 14 ).\nIn 2019 we updated our ESRM-related policy statements \nfollowing a comprehensive review. Enhancements include: \n•   Developed new sector-specific diligence guidelines for \nnuclear power, hydropower, shale oil and gas, and palm oil.\n•  Enhanced sector-specific diligence guidelines for forestry.\n•  Broadened cross-sector diligence guidelines for \nindigenous rights. \n•  Incorporated a new human rights section.\nIn parallel, we rolled out a revised due diligence framework \nthat focuses reviews on higher-risk transactions and updated \ncorresponding procedures across our businesses. To further \nsupport our initiative to increase awareness of environmental \nand social risk, the ESRM team provided training to  \nbusinesses and appointed regional ESRM coordinators in \nEMEA and APAC.\nMonitoring Transactions \nMorgan Stanley monitors financial transactions that could \nexpose the firm to risks raised by environmental and social \nissues. The ESRM team provides guidance to deal teams  \nglobally on potentially material franchise risks. In-scope \ntransactions are reviewed by ESRM and our businesses.  \nWhen a potentially material issue is identified, enhanced due \ndiligence is conducted, including on issues such as human rights, \ndirect and adverse indigenous tribe impacts, and significant \nenvironmental impacts. Depending on the results of the ESRM \nreview, transactions may be escalated to our Regional and \nGlobal Franchise Committees and to senior management.\nFor example, we were invited to execute a transaction for an \nintegrated steel-producing company with steel, mining and \nenergy operations. We engaged in enhanced due diligence \nwith the company to review its Environmental Health and \nSafety (EHS) Management framework, its approach to tailings \ndam management and its engagement with stakeholders. The \ncompany is very focused on environmental and social risk \nmanagement; in particular, its EHS Management System has \nbeen certified in accordance with ISO 14001 standards, and \nis further supported by open communication of concerns by \nits employees and communities. With respect to its tailings \ndam management, the company has retained independent experts to assess the stability of its dams, conducts emergency \npreparedness exercise and has put in place robust controls. \nFinally, the company has undertaken a number of initiatives to \naddress local community concerns. On the basis of this enhanced \ndue diligence, we approved moving forward with the transaction.\nIn another case, we were asked by a client to advise on the \npotential acquisition of a technology company. The technology \ncompany had been the subject of much controversy regarding \nthe use of its technology and potential human rights violations. \nWe reviewed the media coverage and concerns raised by various \ngroups. In further assessing the concerns that had been identified, \nand the company’s apparent failure to adopt appropriate controls \nto eliminate the risks of human rights violations occurring, we \ndeclined to accept the mandate.  \nThe table below shows transactions by industry reviewed by \nESRM in 2019.\nAssessing Climate Risk  \nMorgan Stanley recognizes that climate change poses significant \nrisks to the global economy. Our Environmental and Social \nPolicy Statement  includes enhanced due diligence guidelines \nfor sectors exposed to greater environmental risk, including the \nphysical and transition risks from climate change as highlighted \nby the TCFD. We will be publishing a TCFD report later in  \n2020 that provides further detail on our approach to climate \nrisk management.BY THE NUMBERS\n2019 Transactions by Industry \nReviewed by Environmental and \nSocial Risk Management\nINDUSTRY  2019\nBasic Materials 42\nEnergy 82\nFinancial Institutions 93\nHealthcare 26\nIndustrials 51\nPharmaceuticals 50\nPower and Utilities 101\nReal Estate 40\nRetail 47\nServices 116\nTransportation 11\nGrand Total  659\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT34\nMORGAN STANLEYManaging Human Rights Risk  \nWe conduct business operations in ways that aim to respect, \nprotect and advance the full range of human rights.

We monitor potential \nhuman rights issues in our operations and supply chains through \ndue diligence procedures for relevant sectors and transactions.\nMorgan Stanley is committed to ensuring that modern slavery \nhas no part in our own operations or supply chains. We expect \nour suppliers to follow appropriate policies and practices to \nensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses, including \nmodern slavery and human trafficking. A global cross-functional \nworking group monitors compliance across our supply chain.  \nIn 2019, we strengthened our efforts to help eradicate modern \nslavery by:\n•  Evaluating 150+ responses from a corporate social \nresponsibility survey of our top global suppliers, which \nuncovered no indications of modern slavery and human \ntrafficking.\n•  Updating our Environmental and Social Policy Statement  \nand Statement on Human Rights  to include language on \nmodern slavery. \n•  Attending industry peer group forums on initiatives to  \nreview modern slavery and human trafficking risks within  \nthe sector supply chain.\n•  Conducting a training session with our Legal group to  \nfurther educate the team on our supply chain human \nrights efforts.\nRead the Morgan Stanley Modern Slavery and Human \nTrafficking Statement here.\nCYBERSECURITY \nCybersecurity and information risks for financial institutions are \nrising along with the trend toward direct access to automated, \nelectronic markets. In response, we deploy sophisticated \ncybersecurity and data security programs and tools to protect \nour operations and clients, and collaborate with industry peers \nand government agencies. \nThe Board and its Operations and Technology Committee is \nresponsible for the firm’s global data privacy and cybersecurity \nstrategy, assisted by the Operational Risk Department. We \nemploy cybersecurity and information security policies, \nprocedures, and technologies designed to protect client and \nemployee data against unauthorized disclosure, modification  \nor misuse as well as to address regulatory requirements.As a first line of defense, we require employees to adopt “good \ncyber hygiene”—updating devices and programs, using strong \npasswords and other basic safeguards. The firm’s cybersecurity, \ninfrastructure, and risk professionals respond to disruptive \nevents by leveraging sophisticated data analytics and threat \nintelligence. Dedicated cybersecurity and information security \nteams protect computer systems firmwide in coordination  \nwith the Firm Resiliency Fusion Center.\nIndustry Collaboration  \nWe also collaborate on industry efforts to combat cybersecurity \nchallenges through public-and private-sector forums. Historical \nexamples include initiatives convened by the White House, the \nNational Cyber Security Center and the Japan Financial Services \nAgency. Morgan Stanley is one of six banks that founded the \nFinancial Systemic Analysis & Resilience Center in 2016. \nTo develop tomorrow’s cyber-leaders and widen access to the \nskills they require, we partner with iMentor, Girls Who Code, \nNPower, local universities and other nonprofit organizations. The  \nFirm Resiliency Fusion Center also partners with the U.S. Marine \nCorps to provide fellowships with our cybersecurity team. \nDATA SECURITY AND CLIENT PRIVACY \nSafeguarding client information at all times is essential to our \ngoal to be the world’s first choice for financial services. Our \nbusiness protocols worldwide integrate physical, technical and \nadministrative measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity \nand availability of client information. We also have global \nprivacy and data-protection policies and procedures in place \ngoverning the collection, storage, access, use and disclosure of \nsuch data. Senior leaders from our Legal and Compliance and \nRisk Management teams oversee these standards. On a day-to-\nday basis, employees use cutting-edge technology and regular \nsecurity assessments to maintain the information system storing \ncustomer data. Testing for system vulnerabilities includes:\n•   Independent reviews of online systems by security specialists \nin penetration testing\n•  Scanning and monitoring for known security risks\n•  Application vulnerability assessments\nTo earn client trust, Morgan Stanley is also transparent about \nhow and why it collects personal information.

Morgan Stanley \ninvests in global business continuity and resilience programs \nto prepare for and recover from technological, security and \nenvironmental disruptions. These efforts prioritize the physical \nsafety of our staff and include controls to protect and maintain \nour real estate and technology.\nExpert teams across the firm support the Business Continuity \nManagement (BCM) program and standards, including \nTechnology, Risk Management, Information Security and \nCorporate Services. Dedicated governance and risk committees, \nthe Board’s Operations and Technology Committee and senior \nmanagement all oversee the program. \nBCM personnel provide 24/7 global coverage to monitor and \nmanage disruptive incidents. Each Morgan Stanley business \nhas continuity plans in place for critical business processes and \nessential personnel, overseen by BCM, which provides firmwide \ntraining to employees at least once a year. In 2019, the firm \nmonitored and reacted to 26 extreme weather and natural \nhazard events including hurricanes, wildfires, blizzards and \nearthquakes.\nIn addition, we deploy firmwide protocols for security breaches \nand disruptions in communication technology, and conduct \nemergency communications drills and simulated crisis scenarios. \nMorgan Stanley also plans and practices for extraordinary events  \nat a sector level and shares threat information as appropriate \nwith peers, vendors and relevant government agencies.\nOur People \nOur ability to build value for clients relies on our more than \n60,000 talented employees around the world. Their diverse \nexperiences and perspectives inform their work and greatly \nbenefit our business. We embrace a values-based culture  \nof inclusion where dedicated professionals can collaborate \nto produce breakthrough thinking. We provide development \nopportunities, and health and wellness programs, to help  \nour employees reach their potential. The Board of Directors is engaged in human capital and culture \noversight. Our Board and its CMDS Committee periodically \nreview management succession plans that include, among other \nthings, an assessment of the experience, performance and skills \nof potential successors to our Chairman and CEO. More broadly, \nthe Board, including the CMDS Committee, is regularly updated \nand consulted on key talent hires as well as the firm’s human \ncapital strategy. This strategy is continuously refined based on \nbusiness drivers, employee surveys and the overall environment \nfor talent.\nCULTURE \nMorgan Stanley employees are our main asset. Our core values \nguide decision making aligned to the expectations of our clients, \nshareholders, regulators and directors, and the public. These \nguiding values—Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing, \nLeading With Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back—are at the  \nheart of our strong workplace culture and underpin our success. \nMaintaining a strong employee culture is the focus of our  \nCulture, Values and Conduct Committee of senior managers,  \nwith oversight from the Board of Directors. Our Code of Conduct   \nis central to this program. Every new hire, and every employee \nannually, is required to certify that they understand and \nwill follow its provisions on ethical behavior. To reinforce its \nmessages, we invite new recruits to attend culture panels with \nsenior leaders in each region. Our executives also lead  \nmandatory firmwide culture conversations. \nWe invite employee feedback on our culture and workplace \nthrough an employee survey. In 2019, 91% of employees \nresponded, with 88% stating they were proud to work for \nMorgan Stanley. A significant majority were comfortable raising \na risk, concern or unethical/inappropriate situation with their \nmanager. For more information, see page 60 of our 2019 Form \n10-K  and pages 20–21 of our 2020 Proxy Statement .\nOne measure of a successful business culture is retaining  \ntalented and skilled employees.

Employees \nare expected to follow the letter and spirit of the Code of \nConduct  and the nondiscrimination and anti-harassment policy \napplicable to their region. We strongly encourage our people to \nreport any concerns using the channels described on page 32 .\nPRIORITIZING DIVERSITY AND TALENT \nRecruiting a highly diverse workforce and fostering an inclusive \nwork environment is not only the right thing to do; it is also \ngood for our business. To this end, we pursue a comprehensive \ndiversity and inclusion (D&I) strategy based on four pillars: \naccountability, representation, advancement and culture.\nDriving awareness of, and accountability for, D&I efforts  \namong managers across our businesses is key to making \nprogress. We conduct annual diversity reviews to actively \nmonitor representation as well as the impact of promotions, \nhires and attrition on our talent pipeline. By sharing this \ndiversity information with managers firmwide, we seek to  \ndrive awareness and action.Inclusive Recruitment and Development \nHiring and supporting the careers of underrepresented groups, \nincluding women and minorities, supports our business \nsuccess. To build a diverse talent pipeline, we use global, \ntargeted recruitment and development programs to hire, retain \nand promote women and multicultural talent. Professional \ndevelopment programs offered in 2019 to help employees \nhone key skills, build networks and gain exposure to senior \nmanagement included:\n•   Wealth Management Multicultural Leadership Summit and \nWomen’s Leadership Summit\n•   Women’s Development Program for Vice Presidents and \nExecutive Directors\n•  Platinum Program for female Executive Directors\n•  Leader Engagement and Development Program for Black  \nand Hispanic Vice Presidents and Executive Directors\n•   Multicultural Professional Development Program for analysts \nand associates\n•  Project Catalyst for Analyst and Associate female employees \nEmployee Diversity in the U.S.BY THE NUMBERS\nBLACK  \nOR  \nAFRICAN-  \nAMERICAN\n2.2%\n5.9%\n10.0%\n2.1%\n8.8% \nHISPANIC  \nOR  \nLATINO \n4.5%\n6.5%\n8.7%\n5.6%\n12.1% \n \n \nASIAN\n10.0%\n23.6%\n23.0%\n5.3%\n6.9%AMERICAN-\nINDIAN OR \nALASKAN  \nNATIVE \n0.1%\n0.4%\n0.3%\n0.2%\n0.3%NATIVE-  \nHAWAIIAN  \nOR PACIFIC \nISLANDER\n0.0%\n0.1%\n0.2%\n0.1%\n0.4% \nTWO  \nOR MORE  \nRACES \n0.7%\n1.5%\n2.0%\n1.3%\n1.7% \n \n \nWHITE \n82.5%\n62.1%\n55.9%\n85.5%\n69.8% \n \n \nFEMALE \n18.2%\n38.1%\n44.8%\n20.4%\n78.2% \n \n \nLEVEL\nExecutives / \nSenior Officers \nand Managers\nFirst / Mid Officers \nand Managers\nProfessionals\nSales Workers\nAdministrative \nSupport Workers\n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT37\nMORGAN STANLEYWe also partner with organizations that support recruitment \nof female and minority career reentry candidates.

A fifth of participants in our 2019 U.S. summer \nanalyst and associate classes were non-white, and 50% globally \nwere women. \nAdvancing Pay Equity  \nAmid growing evidence that diverse organizations often \noutperform their peers, we employ policies and practices, \nincluding those on pay, that help attract, retain and advance \nunderrepresented talent. To promote equitable rewards for all \nemployees, including women and ethnically diverse employees, \nwe have enhanced:\n•  Robust practices to support fair and consistent compensation \nand reward decisions based on merit \n•  Ongoing review of compensation decisions, including at the \npoint of hire and promotion \n•  Regular assessment of our rewards structure. \nUnder the U.K. Gender Pay Gap Reporting regulations, we \nprovide gender pay gap data for the Morgan Stanley U.K. group. \nOur latest disclosure is available for download here.CONNECTING WITH COLLEAGUES  \nAn inclusive, collaborative workplace helps to generate stronger \nwork and results from all employees. We encourage our people \nto get to know colleagues who don’t share their background, seek \ninput from a wide range of individuals and embrace opportunities \nto publicly recognize teammates, especially those who are \nunderrepresented at the firm. \nWe also support a popular global network of close to 20 \nemployee affinity groups. These hold year-round networking and \nprofessional development events and enable colleagues across \nbusiness units to share ideas and experiences. \nOur Global Employee Networks\nActive networks across North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific/\nJapan include:\n• African & Caribbean Business Alliance\n• Asian Employee Network\n• Black Employee Network \n• disAbility Employee Network\n• Employee Sustainability Forum\n• Family Network\n• Glasgow Cultural Awareness Network\n• Hong Kong Multicultural Alliance\n• Latino Employee Network\n• Net East Asia\n• Net Éire\n• Net South Asia\n• Pride & Ally LGBT+ Employee Network\n• Veterans Employee Network\n• Women’s Business Alliance\n• Wealth Management Multicultural Employee Network\n• Wealth Management Women’s Employee NetworkOverall Managing  \nDirectorsSummer Analyst  \nand Associate \nClasses39% 21% 50%BY THE NUMBERS\nGlobal Female Representation\nUnder the U.K. Gender Pay Gap Reporting  \nregulations, we provide gender pay gap data  \nfor the Morgan Stanley U.K. group.\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT38\nMORGAN STANLEY\nSUPPORTING DIVERSITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES  \nOur efforts to promote inclusion extend beyond our own walls. \nWherever we operate, we seek to actively support diverse \ncommunities by sponsoring prominent organizations and events \nand by taking a public stand for inclusion. Examples from \n2019 included:\n•   Donating $1 million to the Hispanic Federation’s Campaign \nfor an Even Brighter Latino Community, focused on education \nand service programs. \n•   Promoting LGBT marriage equality in Japan by leading an \ninitiative within the foreign banking community to express \npublic support for the American Chamber of Commerce in \nJapan’s Viewpoint on Marriage Equality .\n•   Committing $1 million to Catalyst, the global women’s \nadvocacy and research organization. The donation will \nsupport ongoing work to advance women and the new  \nNow Is the Moment—Be a Catalyst campaign.

For example: \n•  We actively seek out diverse-owned companies  \nthat can meet our business needs through  \nour Supplier Diversity program. \n•  The Morgan Stanley Multicultural  \nInnovation Lab serves as a tech  \naccelerator for startups led by women  \nand multicultural entrepreneurs. \n2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT39\nMORGAN STANLEYPERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT  \nTo support our goal to be the world’s financial services provider \nof choice, we seek to attract and retain a skilled workforce \nthat delivers for our clients and meets our stakeholders’ \nexpectations. Our performance, pay, promotion and succession \nprocesses are designed to engage and reward talented and \ncommitted individuals while reinforcing our culture and values. \nAnnual employee evaluations include feedback from managers \nand colleagues on overall performance, conduct, risk behavior \nand culture. This input is then factored into compensation and \npromotion decisions, aligning an employee’s demonstrated \nbehavior with his or her rewards.\nBalancing Risk and Reward \nWe pursue responsible and effective compensation programs \nthat reinforce our values and culture through four key \nobjectives: delivering pay for sustainable performance, \nattracting and retaining top talent, aligning with shareholder \ninterests and mitigating excessive risk-taking. The Board’s \nCMDS Committee oversees the firm’s incentive compensation \narrangements in line with these objectives. Together with  \nsenior management, the CMDS Committee oversees:\n•   Policies for funding and allocating incentive compensation, \nand the use of discretion in determining individual incentive \ncompensation awards.\n•   Processes for identifying “material risk taker” employees.\n•   Controls to mitigate the risk of rewarding inappropriate \nconduct and unsatisfactory performance.\n•   Processes to administer incentive compensation clawback  \nand cancellation features.\nIn 2019, on average, 62% of total remuneration was variable \nfor material risk takers, of which 55% was subject to malus or \nclawback provisions.\nWhere we uncover conduct contrary to our policies, disciplinary \naction may include cancellation and clawback of compensation, \nchanges to promotion decisions or termination of employment. \nIn our 2019 employee survey, 80% of respondents agreed \nthere should be personal consequences for those who do not \ndemonstrate the firm’s values.SUPPORTING WELLNESS  \nHealth at Morgan Stanley \nDoing the right thing by our employees and their families  \nincludes offering comprehensive health benefits and resources. \nBenefits vary by country and can include: medical, dental and \nvision coverage; tax-advantaged flexible spending and health \nsavings accounts; and critical illness, accident, disability and  \nlife insurance. \nOur Chief Medical Officer leads our global health care and \nemployee benefits strategy. We partner with leading health and \nfamily-care providers to deliver holistic services that meet our \npeople’s varied needs. In 2019, we expanded fertility, adoption \nand surrogacy benefits for U.S. employees, making it easier for \neveryone seeking treatment to be covered, including those who \nare single or in same-sex relationships.  \nResources for working parents include center-based and in-home \nbackup care, along with help finding caregivers and discounts \non daycare and preschool. In the U.K., we also offer a workplace \nnursery close to our London office. Employees with older \nchildren can access resources to navigate the college application \nprocess and discounts on prep/tutoring for entrance exams.\nWell-Being at Morgan Stanley  \nWe strive to make it simple and convenient for employees \nto achieve their wellness goals. To this end, we offer global \neducation and resources on common health concerns, including \nsleep, nutrition and cancer risks, along with on-site access \nto preventive screenings and flu shots. Our wellness centers \nin the New York metro area, London and Tokyo offer health \ncare providers, physical therapists, fitness facilities and health \ncoaching, including a registered dietician.\nIn 2019, to mark Mental Health Awareness Week, we organized \nworkplace campaigns in the U.S., the U.K. and Hong Kong \ndesigned to challenge stigma, generate awareness and encourage \nconversation. We offer year-round health education sessions on \ntopics such as anxiety, depression and resiliency, along with in-\nperson and virtual meditation. Free on-site counseling is available \nat our New York headquarters and London office. Mental health \nfirst aid training was also introduced in the U.K. this year. \nMorgan Stanley recognizes the increasing demands on its \nemployees’ professional and personal lives. The firm is committed \nto working with employees wherever possible on flexible \narrangements that work for both parties. Options offered to U.S. \nemployees include compressed workweeks, flextime, job sharing, \nreduced work schedules and telecommuting from home.\n2019  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT40\nMORGAN STANLEYAppendix: SASB Index\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) guidance for Investment Banking, \nCommercial Banking and Asset Management help inform the content, narrative and data \nincluded in this report.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\nInvesting in the market entails risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments may increase or decrease over varying time periods. Equity \nsecurities’ prices may fluctuate in response to specific situations for each company, industry, market condition and general economic environment. Companies \npaying dividends can reduce or cut payouts at any time.\nBonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond’s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. \nBonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. \nThe market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the \nmaturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer.\nInternational investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic \nuncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with emerging markets, since these countries \nmay have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economics. REITs’ investing risks are similar to those associated with direct \ninvestments in real estate; lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions.\nPlease note that there is currently no standard definition of “green bond.” Without limiting any of the statements contained herein, Morgan Stanley \nSmith Barney LLC makes no representation or warranty as to whether this bond constitutes a green bond or conforms to investor expectations or objectives \nfor investing in green bonds. For information on characteristics of the bond, use of proceeds, a description of applicable project(s), and/or any other relevant \ninformation about the bond, please reference the offering documents for the bond.\nAlternative investments often are speculative and include a high degree of risk. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. \nAlternative investments are suitable only for eligible, long-term investors who are willing to forgo liquidity and put capital at risk for an indefinite period of time. \nThey may be highly illiquid and can engage in leverage and other speculative practices that may increase the volatility and risk of loss. Alternative investments \ntypically have higher fees than traditional investments. Investors should carefully review and consider potential risks before investing.\nPrivate Funds (which include hedge funds are private equity funds) often engage in speculative investment techniques and are only suitable for long-term, \nqualified investors. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. They are generally illiquid, not tax efficient and have higher fees than \nmany traditional investments.\nThe investor should note that funds that invest exclusively in one sector or industry involve additional risks. The lack of industry diversification subjects the \ninvestor to increased industry-specific risks.\nInvestment returns will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than original cost. Investors should carefully \nconsider the investment objectives and risks as well as charges and expenses of a mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) before investing. To obtain \na prospectus, contact your Financial Advisor or visit the fund company’s website. The prospectus contains this and other information about the mutual \nfund or ETF. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.\nThe returns on a portfolio consisting primarily of Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) aware investments or sustainable investments may be lower \nor higher than a portfolio that is more diversified or where decisions are based solely on investment considerations. Because ESG or sustainability criteria \nexclude some investments, investors may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as investors that do not use such criteria.\nThe Global Investment Committee is a group of seasoned investment professionals who meet regularly to discuss the global economy and markets. The \ncommittee determines the investment outlook that guides our advice to clients. They continually monitor developing economic and market conditions, review \ntactical outlooks and recommend model portfolio weightings, as well as produce a suite of strategy, analysis, commentary, portfolio positioning suggestions and \nother reports and broadcasts.\nMorgan Stanley & Co.

Employee satisfaction is up, reflecting an \nimprovement in the way we engage with and \nsupport our people. We have improved the way  \nwe listen to customers and acted on that feedback, \nand we have simplified our governance structures \nto create clearer and stronger lines of authority.  \nWe have also accelerated our support for the \nlow-carbon transition.\nYet for all our strides, there are areas where we can \nand must do better. Our senior leadership teams \nare still not diverse enough. Many of our customers \nstill find it too difficult to bank with us. On conduct, \nwe have more to do in adapting to changing \nsocietal expectations. \nAddressing these aspects of our performance  \nwill take time. There are no quick or easy fixes.  \nBut where there is work to be done, we will do  \nso with urgency, conviction and clear purpose. \nAs Group Chief Executive, my overriding priority  \nis to create stronger relationships with all our \nstakeholders – and it is part of our ambition to \ncreate what we call the healthiest human system  \nin our industry. If we can do that, and live up to  \nour wider societal obligations, then we believe  \nwe will materially improve all aspects of HSBC’s \nperformance and safeguard the future of the \norganisation for generations to come. \nAll of you reading this are part of that ambition. \nYour feedback and your views are important to  \nus. We will continue to take them into account,  \nand to listen, learn and act. \nI hope you find the report useful.  \nJohn Flint\nGroup Chief ExecutiveLiving up to our wider societal obligations  \nhas always been part of HSBC’s culture and \nidentity. Our success over 154 years has been \nfounded on our ability to build strong and trusted \nrelationships not just with our customers, but  \nwith the communities and other stakeholders  \nwe serve all over the world. \nWe recognise that there have been times, \nparticularly in the recent past, where we have \nfailed to meet the standards expected of us.\nSocietal expectations are changing, and investors \nare placing increasing importance on the wider \nimpact businesses have on people and the planet. \nSo over the past few years we have taken steps  \nto improve all aspects of our non-financial \nperformance, and to live up to the duty of  \ncare we have to all our stakeholders today. \nThis ESG Update  – the fourth we have produced \n– shines a light on our progress. It covers all the \nusual areas, from corporate governance and our \nenvironmental impact, to customer satisfaction  \nand our approach to conduct.

These human \nconnections are complex  \nand overlap. Many of our \nemployees are customers  \nand shareholders, while our \nbusiness customers are often \nsuppliers. We exist to serve, \ncreating value for our \ncustomers and shareholders. \nOur size and global reach \nmean our actions can have  \na significant impact, which  \nis why we want to create  \nthe healthiest human system \nin financial services to help \nenable our business strategy.\nWe listen to our stakeholders in a number of different ways, \nfrom employee and customer surveys to client meetings. \nInvestors tell us what matters to them in the annual ESG \ninvestor survey and in qualitative assessments during investor \nmeetings. We are also informed by stock exchange listing  \nand disclosure rules in Hong Kong, the UK and the US.\nWe use this information to identify what issues are material  \nto our stakeholders, taking into account the nature of our \nbusiness. In line with the provisions of the ESG Guide,  \nan issue is considered to be material when management \ndetermines that it has become sufficiently important to  \nour stakeholders that it should be publicly reported.Management tables material issues for discussion at the  \nESG Steering Committee and other relevant governance \nforums. We use these themes and concerns as a guide  \nfor our ESG Update . Further information about the ESG \nSteering Committee is included in the ‘Ensuring strong \ncorporate governance’ section of the report on page 40. \nWe acknowledge that material issues evolve over time,  \nand we will continue to assess them to ensure we remain \ncurrent in our approach and communications. \n5\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nOur approach \nReporting on material issues in an open  \nand transparent way is key to meeting  \nthe expectations of our stakeholders. \nOur ESG approach\n –We support the global transition to the \nlow-carbon economy through our own \nsustainable operations and by supporting \nour customers with their transition.\n –We maintain robust climate-related risk \nmanagement, covering sensitive sectors, \nsuch as energy, palm oil and forestry.\n –We aim to maintain high standards  \nof governance across all geographies.\n –We are committed to protecting our \ncustomers and communities through \nfinancial crime risk management and \ncybersecurity due diligence.Environmental\nSocial\nGovernanceExamples:\n –In our ambition to provide $100bn of sustainable financing, \nfacilitation and investment by 2025, we have delivered  \na cumulative total of $28.5bn since 2017, with external \nassurance of this number provided by PwC using ISAE \n3000.

This \nincludes information on the strengthening of our controls, \nand achieving fair outcomes for customers and culture.\n –Our employee surveys give us invaluable insight into our \npeople. Results in 2018 show that 74% feel able to speak  \nup when they see behaviour that they consider to be wrong.\n –We are building a diverse workforce and have set a target  \nof 30% women holding senior leadership roles by 2020. \nCurrently 28% of our senior leaders are women, so while  \nwe are making progress we recognise there is still room  \nfor improvement.\nOur conduct approach\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility for good conduct \nthrough the delivery of fair outcomes for customers and \nbehaving in a way that protects financial markets integrity.  \nWe have therefore implemented a conduct framework \ndescribing the outcomes that must be delivered across the \nGroup and which in turn form a key component of our risk \nmanagement framework. This means that our decisions should \nconsider the impact on customers and markets. In addition, delivery of the required Group values and conduct behaviours \ncontinues to be considered in performance management  \nfor our people across the Group. Our conduct is overseen  \nby senior risk and executive committees within each of our \nbusinesses, functions and HSBC Operations Services and \nTechnology. The Board maintains oversight of conduct  \nmatters through the Group Risk Committee.  –We aim to grow in a way that puts the \ncustomer at the centre.\n –We want to create the healthiest human \nsystem in our industry. We are working to \ncreate the right environment so everyone \ncan fulfil their potential.\n –We are focusing on diversity and inclusion \nin our workforce, and we are striving to \nput the customer at the heart of everything \nwe do.\n6\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Overview\n Customers\nWe aim to grow in a way that puts the  \ncustomer at the centre by improving  \nperformance with digital enhancements  \nwhile maintaining financial crime standards. \nAt a glance\nOur relationship\nOur purpose is to be where the growth is, connecting \ncustomers to opportunities. We help enable businesses  \nto thrive and economies to prosper, helping people fulfil  \ntheir hopes and dreams and realise their ambitions. \nWe create value by providing the products and services  \nour customers need, and aim to do so in a way that fits \nseamlessly into their lives. This helps us to build long-lasting \nrelationships with our customers. We maintain trust by \nstriving to protect our customers’ data and information,  and delivering fair outcomes for them – and if things  \ngo wrong, we need to address complaints in a timely \nmanner. Operating with high standards of conduct is  \ncentral to our long-term success and underpins our  \nability to serve our customers.\nIn this section we report on our customers as four  \ndistinct groups: our retail customers; medium and large-\nsized corporate customers; global and institutional \ncustomers; and high net worth customers. These groups  \n are serviced by our four global businesses respectively: \nRetail Banking and \nWealth Management \n(‘RBWM’)Commercial Banking \n(‘CMB’)Global Banking and \nMarkets (‘GB&M’)Global Private  \nBanking (‘GPB’)\nWe help 38 million customers \nacross the world to manage \ntheir finances, buy their \nhomes, and save and invest  \nfor the future.\nOur HSBC Premier and \nAdvance propositions are \naimed at mass affluent and \nemerging affluent customers \nwho value international \nconnectivity. For customers \nwith simpler banking needs, \nwe offer a full range of \nproducts and services \nreflecting local requirements. We support approximately  \n1.5 million business customers \nin 53 countries and territories, \nranging from small enterprises \nfocused primarily on their \ndomestic markets, through  \nto large companies  \noperating globally.\nOur services include working \ncapital, term loans, payment \nservices and international \ntrade facilitation, as well as \nexpertise in mergers and \nacquisitions, and access  \nto financial markets.We serve approximately  \n4,100 clients in more than 50 \ncountries and territories.

We also launched our Universal \nBanker programme in five markets,  \nwhich helps train our people to be digitally \nequipped, and empowers them to resolve \nmore queries themselves. Over 4,000 \nemployees are now Universal Bankers.  \nLess positively, the satisfaction score of  \nour US contact centres fell and overall \ncomplaints rose, driven by a significant \noverhaul of the banking platform, which \nled to increased call volumes and customer \nwait times. We addressed this through \nincreasing headcount and expanding our \nchatbot capabilities.We listen to our customers in a number  \nof different ways, including through our \ninteractions with them, surveys, social \nmedia and from their complaints. We use \nthese insights to improve our services.  \nCustomer recommendation \nIn 2018, we surveyed more than two million \ncustomers on their likelihood to recommend \nHSBC to others and their satisfaction  \nwith our services. We have made some \nprogress, with recommendation scores \nimproving in the majority of markets. More \ncustomers recommended us for being \neasily accessible, offering good digital \nservices, and our overall customer service. \nHowever, our savings accounts remain an \narea of dissatisfaction, with more customers \ntelling us they are seeking competitive rates \nand charges. In the UK, the First Direct \nbrand ranked first for mobile banking \nservices and second overall in the \nCompetition and Markets Authority \nrankings in 2018, where banks were scored \nby customers on the quality of service.\nIn 2018, we changed the way we  \nreport customer recommendation by \nbroadening the range of customers we \nsurvey, and by looking at the full range of \nscores provided. We believe this provides  \na more representative and complete \nperspective on the customer service  \nwe offer relative to the market. \nCustomer satisfaction \nCustomer satisfaction in our online banking \nservices rose in some of our key markets in \n2018, following significant declines in the \nprevious year. The decline in satisfaction in \n2017 came after the launch of a new online \nbanking system and enhanced security \nfeatures. The new platform should help \nenable us to roll out new digital services at \na faster pace while keeping our customers \nsafe. However, we saw a drop in customer \nsatisfaction as customers learned how to \nuse the new service. By listening to our \ncustomers, we improved the way we \ncommunicated changes and fixed a \nnumber of the issues that were causing  \nthe most frustration, such as login and \npayments.

The index uses the 0–10 rating scale for the customer recommendation question to create a 100 point index. \nThis survey is run by an independent and global market research agency. Following the reporting change, \n2018 and 2017 figures have been restated to focus on the full range of scores provided by customers.\naffected markets in 2018, the UK, Canada, \nUS and China, experienced recoveries  \nin customer satisfaction. However, in  \nHong Kong, our customers were more \ndissatisfied by our browser-based banking \nexperience. We have responded with new \ninitiatives to improve the experience such \nas adding real-time customer assistance \ncapabilities, and plan to continue \nenhancements to our capabilities. In 2018, \nwe focused our efforts on upgrading our \nmobile banking experience where we have \nseen the highest growth in customer \nusage.

Apple’s Touch ID is now live in 18 markets and HSBC Voice ID  \nis in five markets. Last year, 80% of customer transactions were conducted via mobile or online channels. More than 30%  \nof loans, cards and deposits sales were through digital channels.\nIn the UK, we trained our front-line people to become more digitally proficient. In branch or on the phone, they can show \ncustomers how to complete tasks digitally. Last year, 85% of new customers opened accounts through a supported  \ndigital experience.\nMaking our  \nprocesses easierIn the UK, we are simplifying our mortgage process. Applications can be approved within 10 days with the help of \nautomatic valuations, improved credit policies and increased underwriter availability.\nTo make investing more accessible, we equipped our branch employees in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore \nwith mobile tablets, and launched an online financial health check. Customers can now understand their investment \noptions in their own time, without a specialist appointment. For more information on our digital enhancements, please  \nsee ‘Our investment in technology’ on page 18.\nMaking it easy to \nunderstand us and  \nour fees and chargesIn Singapore, we simplified our mortgage application forms and offer letters, so customers can be clear about their \nrepayment schedule, terms and conditions, and fees and charges. \nThrough digital messaging we are raising customer awareness around overdrafts in the UK, Hong Kong, France and the  \nUS. In the UK, we expanded the volume of overdraft alerts, which we first introduced in 2017, sending more than 26 million \nalerts in 2018 to help customers save money. Over half (56%) of customers who receive an alert pay in funds to avoid \ncharges. To help even more customers avoid fees, we are introducing services like our Connected Money app, which  \nhelps people keep track of their spending (see page 11).\nWhen things go wrong\nWe aim to ensure customers’ complaints \nare recorded so we can understand what \nwent wrong and why, and then act upon \nthe feedback. Complaints are monitored \nand reported to governance forums. \nSenior executives are measured against \ncomplaint-handling performance. \nThe way we handle complaints and how \nfast we respond is important to us and our \ncustomers. In 2018, we resolved 77% of \ncomplaints on the same or next working \nday, and 86% within five working days, \nexcluding UK complaints related to \npayment protection insurance (‘PPI’).  \nThe most common complaints related to \nprocess and procedures (39%), service \n(25%), and fees and charges (9%).\nIn 2018, we received approximately 1.2 \nmillion complaints from retail customers  \nin our large markets referenced in the \nadjacent table, a 16% increase compared \nwith 2017, primarily driven by the UK and \nMexico. The increase in UK complaints \nmainly related to PPI, which is consistent \nacross the UK industry, and to digital \nregistration issues. An improvement \nprogramme for non-PPI complaints was introduced in 2018, resulting in complaint \nvolumes declining in the fourth quarter. Our \nbusiness in Mexico experienced an increase \nin complaints due to the prevalence of \nonline fraud transactions leading to service \ninterruption. We provided refunds to the \ncustomers and strengthened our fraud \ncontrol measures, as well as launching a \ncard control app that allows customers to \nmanage deactivating controls on online \ncard usage. As of September 2018, the \nFinancial Services Consumers Protection \nBureau in Mexico ranked HSBC as the best \nbank among the seven largest banks for \ncomplaint resolution and quality of service \non their Customer Care Performance Index. \nComplaints at our UAE business fell 18%, \nbut remained relatively high. Complaints \nwere primarily due to manual processes, \nservice delays, staff knowledge and clarity \nof our communication to customers. These \ncontinue to be addressed through a \ncustomer experience programme.\n1.

We \nmanage this through a range of activities, \nfrom working to ensure products are \ndesigned fairly to endeavouring to  \nmeet customers’ financial needs. \nWe have put in place clear policies, \nframeworks and governance to protect  \nour customers. Our conduct and risk \nframeworks describe the outcomes that \nmust be delivered across the Group. In \nperformance management, we consider \nwhether behaviour is in line with our \nvalues. Conduct is overseen by senior risk \nand executive committees, while the Board \nmaintains oversight of conduct matters \nthrough the Group Risk Committee. \nProduct design and fair value \nGood product design helps provide the \nright outcomes for our customers. We \nprovide training through the Product \nManagement Academy. To date, more \nthan 1,000 of our people have completed \ntraining on topics including customer \ninsight, customer-focused design,  \nmaking communications simple, product \ndevelopment, management oversight  \nand governance. \nCustomer insight is the foundation of  \nthe design process, so we work with \ncustomer research groups to co-create \nsolutions. This involves checking in  \nwith customer panels and user labs \nthroughout the process to understand \ncustomer reaction, so we can dynamically \nadapt designs to meet changing needs. \nIn Mexico, we launched our Stilo  \nbanking service, which includes a money \nmanagement tips app, filling a gap in \nservice that our customers had told us \nabout. In Hong Kong, we worked with \nmore than 3,000 customers to design  \nand test our PayMe services and features \nbefore launching them, including peer-to-\npeer payments for customers and \nnon-customers. PayMe reached a \nmilestone of approximately 1.5 million \nusers in 2018. The range of products offered in our \nmarkets is managed globally. Any newly \ndeveloped product goes through a \nreview process with global oversight for \ndifferent or complex products. During \nthis process, products are tested to help \nensure they are suitable and offer fair \nvalue to customers.\nOngoing monitoring is also a critical \ncomponent of our product governance \nprogramme. Regular in-depth reviews \nrecognise a product or service may \nbecome unsuitable over a period of time, \nwhether it is after a significant event  \nor following an accumulation of  \nmultiple changes.\nProduct design key principles:\nOur products should remain relevant  \nin each country they are offered.\nWe offer a consistent, simple and \ncarefully selected range of products.\nWe act on feedback from customers  \nto provide better and more accessible \nproducts/services. \nProducts that no longer meet our  \nhigh standards or customer needs  \nare withdrawn from sale.\nWe also conduct regular product reviews \nand fair value assessments in each of the \nmarkets we operate in, to help ensure we \ndeliver fair value.\nPricing key principles:\nAll products and services must meet  \na minimum set of design standards.\nWe carry out regular comparisons  \nof HSBC pricing with those of local \ncompetitors and with our own fair  \nvalue standards, considering the total \ncharges and features of a product.\nWe review the usage levels of product \nfeatures to assess if customers’ \nbehaviours and responses demonstrate \nthey are receiving value.Oversight and governance of our  \nfair value assessments and product \nsafety is provided by the Global Wealth \nManagement Oversight Committee, \nchaired by the Global Head of Wealth \nProducts, and the Retail Banking \nManagement Committee, chaired  \nby the Global Head of Retail Products. \nThe RBWM Global Incentive Committee, \nwhich reports to the Chief Executive \nOfficer of RBWM, oversees front-line \nemployee incentives.\nMeeting our customers’ needs\nIn order to meet customers’ needs \neffectively, we have robust oversight of \nthe sales process, including reviewing \nthe suitability of the products we offer, \nsales quality monitoring, and how we \nincentivise our staff.\nWe consider our customers’ financial \nneeds and personal circumstances to \nassist us in offering suitable product \nrecommendations. This is achieved \nthrough: \n –a globally consistent methodology  \nto rate the riskiness of investment \nproducts, which is customised for  \nlocal regulatory requirements;\n –a robust customer risk profiling \nmethodology to help assess \ncustomers’ financial objectives, \nattitude towards risk, financial ability  \nto bear investment risk and their \nknowledge and experience;\n –goal projection tools and calculators  \nto help customers plan for their future \nin line with their overall investment \nobjectives; and \n –consistent global advisory standards to \nfollow when we make recommendations \nto our customers, while taking into \naccount local regulations.\nFrom a service perspective, our goal  \nis to empower our people to resolve \nissues. In the UK, we embedded a \nprogramme to give front-line employees \na means to raise and contribute towards \nsolving customer issues and to escalate Spotlight: Conduct\n10\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Customers | Our  Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\nlarger issues to executive management. \nSince introducing the programme in  \nlate 2017, over 8,000 issues have been \nraised, and in 2018 more than 6,500  \nwere resolved.  \nSales quality\nTo assure the quality of our sales process \nand employees’ behaviour in each of our \nmarkets, we either conduct a mystery \nshopping programme or a sales quality \nprogramme, or both. Issues identified are \ntreated seriously. Action is taken to help \nachieve a fair outcome for customers.\nWhere concerns are found, we will \ncontact the customer to explain and \nremediate. Depending on the severity  \nof the issue, the relevant employee will \nbe given enhanced training to improve \ntheir behaviour and they may become \nineligible for an incentive reward \npayment. Where a case of misconduct \noccurs, disciplinary action may be  \ntaken, which can lead to dismissal.   \nFront-line employee incentives\nIn 2013, we changed our front-line \nincentives to create a discretionary \nframework rather than a straight formula \nbetween sales and reward. Our people \nare now recognised for demonstrating \nour values and behaviours as well as \nmeeting customers’ needs through \nproducts and services. The framework \nexists to recognise our front-line \nemployees who go above and beyond  \nfor the customer, to deliver fair outcomes \nand support the sustainable growth of \nour business.Aligned to our customer experience \nstandards, the incentive framework \nassesses how our people listen to our \ncustomers to understand their needs  \nso that they can provide appropriate \nsolutions. Should an individual \ndemonstrate behaviours that do not  \nalign with our core values, there is a \ndisciplinary process that again can  \naffect reward payments.\nBuilding financial capability \nDelivering fair outcomes for customers \nalso involves providing tools and content \nthat help customers have the confidence \nand competence to make the most of \ntheir money. In 2018, we made public \ncommitments around building financial \ncapability, and we took a number of \nactions to deliver on these commitments:\n –In the UK, we launched the HSBC \nConnected Money app, which helps \nusers see all their banking relationships \nin one place and keep track of how  \nthey spend their money. It has been \ndownloaded 240,000 times. One  \nrecent new feature allows users to  \nkeep track of savings goals using  \nvirtual savings pots.\n –We introduced card control features  \nin the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico,  \nso customers can control their  \ncard spending and receive real-time \nalerts on their activity. In Mexico, \ncustomers can set spending limits  \nand block spending categories,  \nsuch as online shopping and \nentertainment, including gambling.\n For further details on how we support  \nbuilding financial capability and inclusion,  \nsee pages 34 and 44.Managing fraud\nFraudulent activities are a risk and  \na concern for our customers. We  \nare committed to mitigating and \nreducing their impact through a  \nrange of actions, including new fraud \nprevention systems, improvements to \nour internal processes and procedures, \nas well as communications to raise \nawareness. We introduced an automated \ncustomer contact solution, which uses \ntwo-way SMS messaging, in the second \nhalf of 2018. Since its introduction, \naround 4,000 customers per day are  \nable to respond instantly to our fraud \nenquiries to either unblock their card  \nor report fraud. Approximately half of  \nall card fraud-related queries are now \nresolved without the need of a phone \nconversation, which has saved \ncustomers approximately 87,000 calls \nevery month. We plan to introduce this  \nservice to more of our customers \nthroughout 2019.\nOperational resilience \nHSBC invests in the reliability and \nresilience of our systems to help prevent \ndisruption to customers. During 2018,  \nwe continued to upgrade our IT systems, \nsimplifying our service provision and \nreplacing older IT infrastructure and \napplications. These enhancements led  \nto continued global improvements in \nservice availability during the year for \nboth our customers and employees.\n For further details on how we aim to maintain \nand continually improve our operational \nresilience capability, see page 19.Spotlight: Conduct continued\n11\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Our Retail Banking and Wealth Management customers\nOur Commercial Banking  \ncustomers \nHow we listen to our customers\nActing on feedbackWe are committed to improving customer \nsatisfaction for all our business customers, \nfrom start-ups to large corporates.\nWe have introduced additional governance \nto embed a customer-led approach into \nour decision making. In 2018, we created \nthe new role of Global Head of Customer \nExperience, and appointed customer \nchampions in key business areas. \nNew tools have been introduced to help \nus understand our customers. These \ninclude customer journey mapping, which \naims to take a holistic approach to assess \ncustomers’ current experiences and \ndesign ideal ones. More than 350 of our \npeople globally have been trained in its \nuse. New artificial intelligence (‘AI’) tools \nused by our insight and analytics teams \nalso allow us to scrutinise more open-\nended feedback from customers quickly \nand accurately.\nCustomer satisfaction\nWe use syndicated research, feedback \nfrom social media, and operational data \nto help us identify what areas are most \nimportant to our customers, and where \nour performance could be improved. Areas of focus include the ease and \nspeed of the account opening process, \nour efficiency in dealing with queries  \nand our range of products. \nWe still have some way to go to achieve \nour ambitions, but our rank position against \ncompetitors for customer satisfaction either \nremained flat or improved compared with \nlast year in seven of our eight key markets.1\nMoments of Truth\nIn 2018, we fully embedded our Moments \nof Truth programme, surveys which allow \nus to continually capture feedback from \ncustomers about interactions we know are \nimportant to them. We have surveyed over \n18,000 customers across 40 markets and \nhave driven improvements through more \nthan 100 actions taken to address the \nfeedback. Key performance metrics across \nall these key events, such as opening  \nan account, calling our contact centres, \nsetting up internet banking, applying for \ncredit or changing relationship manager, \nhave improved in 2018. We actively \nreview the interactions we measure to \nmake sure we continue to focus on the \nissues that matter most to our customers. \nListening to customers and acting on their feedback has helped us to drive improvements to the customer experience.  \nHere are some of the main issues raised and how we responded.\nArea of focus Action\nImproving the  \nease and speed of \naccount openingIn the UK, we created a new welcome journey for small businesses. This resulted in improved customer satisfaction \nand increased use of self-service digital tools. In France, we sped up the opening of accounts by simplifying the \nprocess. In Singapore, new customers are now assigned a single point of contact to help them. A customised video \nalso introduces customers to their service team and helps them to get started with online banking. \nCustomer query \nhandlingWe want to make sure our people are fully equipped to answer customer enquiries efficiently and effectively. We \nprovided additional training for customer service managers in our Global Trade and Receivables Finance business  \nin Singapore and Hong Kong, as well as for our HSBCnet telephone teams to improve their technical and soft skills.  \nIn the UK, a query escalation process was introduced to improve our ability to resolve queries quickly and accurately. \nEasy channels  \nto communicate \nfeedbackIn order to help make sure our products and services meet customers’ needs, we have more than 200 customers  \nas active members of online panels in the UK, Hong Kong, mainland China, Australia, UAE, Mexico and the US. These \nprovide fast feedback, allowing us to test changes directly with customers. In 2018, they helped us redesign our online \nbanking platform and provided input into developments around integration of third-party accounting software.Case study: Customer-centric \npayments review\nA customer-centric review was \nlaunched to improve the efficiency  \nof our payment processing across \nAsia-Pacific. We created a smoother \nauthentication process through  \na one-time password issued  \nto customers by text message.  \nThis avoided three authentication \nquestions, which customers told  \nus were difficult to use. Customer \nqueries are now handled faster by \ngiving wider access to the payment \nsystems to our employees. These \nchanges contributed towards a  \n70% reduction of payments-related \ncomplaints, from their highest point  \nin 2017, and a fall in average call \nhandling time from 11 to seven minutes.\n1.  Eight key markets: Hong Kong, UK, Pearl River Delta, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and UAE. Customer satisfaction metrics for Pearl River Delta will \nbe available from 2019. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Mexico and UAE, CMB performance in 2017 is based on the bank that the customer defines as their \nmain bank, while CMB performance for these markets in 2018 is based on the bank that the customer defines as the most important. Surveys are based on a \nrelevant and representative subset of the market.

Without \nthose details, services were sometimes \nrestricted and, in certain circumstances, \naccounts were closed. After reviewing \ncustomer communications, we have \nimproved the content and layout of letters, \nmaking the process clearer and simpler.\nOperational complaints were the  \nsecond highest in volume (25% of total \ncomplaints), reflecting the most frequent \ncustomer transactions. Improvements in the payment processes and the way  \nwe handle queries reduced complaints \nsignificantly in Asia-Pacific. We are keen \nto learn from these events to improve \ncustomer experience in other markets.\nAccount opening complaints reflected  \nthe third largest in volume (7% of total \ncomplaints).

To help make sure all  \nour products meet customer needs,  \nwe have a rigorous governance and  \napproval process for any new product  \nor significant changes to existing ones. \nWe operate sales outcome testing  \nin 12 key markets designed to ensure \ncustomers have understood the features \nof their chosen products, such as pricing, \nmechanics, risk and benefits. In 2018,  \nwe identified 132 issues through the \nCMB outcome testing programme, such \nas documentation, sales process, and \npricing issues. Actions are underway to \naddress these issues.\nWe recognise it is important to provide \nour products at a fair price and in a \ntransparent way. Since late 2017, an executive pricing steering committee  \nhas been improving our existing pricing \nframework to help make sure we  \nprice products and services fairly, \ncommunicate transparently, and have \nrobust controls in place. Following our \nfocused efforts, complaints around fees \nand charges have fallen by 20% over  \nthe last two years.\nWe have put a strong emphasis on \ncommunicating to our people on how  \nwe should behave. We broadcast videos \nof senior leaders speaking about what \nconduct means to them and why it is \nimportant. We feature examples of \nemployees making the right decisions  \nin the interests of customers in global \nemployee communications. Countries, \nregions and global operations all held \nconduct-themed workshops, informal \nExchange sessions and town halls.  Spotlight: Conduct\nThis has resulted in a significant input  \nof ideas and concerns that have allowed \nour leaders to shape their own conduct \nagendas and communications. For \nfurther details of our Exchange forums, \nsee the Employees section on page 22. \nThe scorecards for front-line employees \nare now balanced with a maximum  \nof 50% being related to performance.  \nWe are increasingly seeing instances of \nrole model behaviours driving upward \nadjustments in variable pay from 1%  \nin 2015 to 8% in 2017.\nFraud is a growing problem and we strive \nto protect our customers from financial \ncrime. In Mexico, we introduced training \nfor our relationship managers focused  \non business email compromise and \nmalware fraud so they can pass on this \nknowledge to customers and take the \nright action if a customer is affected.an increase in complaints. In France,  \nrapid business growth during early 2018 \nresulted in higher than expected account \nopening requests, increasing the time \ntaken to open accounts. Additional \nresources were employed and changes \nimplemented to streamline the process, \nresulting in a reduction in complaints later \nin the year.\n1.

Each aspect  \nof the survey is carefully reviewed to \nconsider which actions can be taken  \nto improve customer perceptions of  \nus and the service we offer. \nOne area where customers were \ndissatisfied was our account opening \nrequirements and how we update \ncustomer information. Some customers \nfelt that these were too cumbersome  \nand time-consuming. \nAs a first step, our credit and lending  \nteam is rolling out a digital credit platform, \na service that provides customers with standardised, automatically populated \ncredit documentation that can be signed \ndigitally. This service, now available in the \nUK, has reduced the time it takes for our \ncustomers to receive financing. \nWe are simplifying our know your \ncustomer (‘KYC’) questionnaire and \nworked with compliance to streamline \nthe KYC aspect of customer onboarding. \nThis improved our risk management \nprocess and reduced verification times \nby 25%.

In November 2018, we created a new \nglobal team to look specifically at customer experience. With \na broad mandate, it focuses on careful analysis of feedback \nand rapid resolution of complaints. \nOne of its immediate tasks is to consolidate customer \nfeedback and complaints across multiple business lines, \ngeographies and products. This should help us improve the \ncustomer experience, and identify any areas for collaboration \nor early detection of potential issues.\nCustomer experience meetings are now scheduled regularly \nwith our top management. These bring together senior people \nto look closely at customer concerns and produce consistent, \nbusiness-wide solutions. we collect and store KYC information, \ntechnology solutions and data access. \nWe reduced onboarding times for our \ncorporate customer base by 8% by the \nend of 2018.

This was an increasing \nreputational risk for the firm. When we looked into the \nproblem for them, it focused our attention on similar  \nissues faced by our existing customers. Not only did  \nwe win this firm as a new customer, we also proposed  \nto take a proactive approach to screening payments  \nfor existing clients, which notifies customers of any  \ndelays and obtains additional information needed to \nidentify and release blocked payments within a target  \nof 48 hours. By making sure we collect information on \nregular beneficiaries upfront and use it effectively, we have \nsignificantly reduced payment delays for our customers. \n14\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Customers\nWhen things go wrong\nOverall, the number of complaints \nincreased in 2018, mainly in Global \nLiquidity and Cash Management \n(‘GLCM’) due to a number of significant \nsystems upgrades and issues throughout \nthe year. In most other GB&M \nbusinesses, the number of complaints \neither reduced or remained stable from \n2017. In Global Markets, we had a \nreduction in complaints resulting from \nhuman error and processing issues in  \nour operations team. In Global Banking, \nthe number of recorded complaints fell, in part due to improvements to how  \nwe record feedback. Previously, many \ncomplaints that were related to the range \nof products and services offered by \nHSBC were recorded by Global Banking, \nwhere the overall customer relationship \nis managed. In 2018, we have aimed, \nwhere possible, to record specific \ncomplaints in relation to products and \nservices against their specific product \nline such as GLCM and Global Trade  \nand Receivables Finance products.\nSpotlight: Conduct\nImproving employee conduct remains one \nof GB&M’s core priorities as we continue to \npursue the highest standards across every \naspect of our business. The way in which \nwe conduct business helps us fulfil  \nour purpose of connecting clients to \nopportunities and helping economies to \ngrow, while staying true to our values. \nCustomers rely on us for our financing, \nadvisory and research expertise. They know \nwe can access global debt, equity, currency \nand commodity markets. It is vital that they \ntrust us to manage their liquidity, keep their \nassets safe, and finance their trade. \nIn 2018, we took a fresh look at how  \nto help deliver fair outcomes for our \ncustomers, and help ensure we do  \nnot cause disruption to the orderly and \ntransparent operation of financial markets. \nWe worked with third-party experts to \nhighlight areas that needed improvement, \nwhich led to a comprehensive new \nprogramme to improve our conduct. The \nkey areas of focus are highlighted below: \nCulture and environment\n –We are expanding the dialogue  \non conduct to help ensure we are \nsupporting our people to make values-\nbased judgements in situations they  \nface every day, and feel safe raising \nconcerns. In the first half of 2018, 5,200 \nof our people attended 650 Exchange \nmeetings to discuss our conduct and \nculture, with further Exchange meetings \nheld through the rest of 2018.\n –We have developed a network of conduct \nchampions across the business to help \ndrive conduct awareness and provide a \ngroup of enthusiastic, committed people \nto act as local sponsors for behavioural change. We have led region-specific \nconduct weeks, where we highlighted \nexamples of conduct in action across the \nbusiness, and produced and updated \ncountry-specific conduct handbooks. \n –We have a complex footprint across \ndifferent businesses, countries and desks. \nThis can lead to a number of different \ncultures – some of which will have issues \nthat need to be addressed. In 2018,  \nwe began a series of pilot exercises to \nexamine the root causes of employee  \nand team behaviour, and to help design \ninterventions. This will continue in 2019.\n –We introduced a new hiring guide  \nfor managers to support the assessment  \nand selection of candidates, and \nstrengthen our interview process  \nwith a broader inclusion of values  \nand behavioural measures.\n –Our management and staff wanted more \ntraining on conduct and how it applies  \nto them and their roles. We continue  \nto improve our conduct curriculum to \nmeet this demand, including coverage  \nof behavioural drivers, conflicts, grey \nareas and specific technical training.\nEmbedding conduct in core \nbusiness processes\n –We have created a Global Markets \nproduct risk function and appointed \nco-Heads of Product Governance in \nGlobal Markets to improve product \ngovernance. Product due diligence \ntemplates used across GB&M have been \nenhanced in an effort to ensure conduct \nis more carefully considered. Sales \nsuitability procedures have been \ndeveloped for people working in Global \nBanking and the Institutional Client Group, and training has commenced  \nfor Global Markets sales employees. \n –In our Exchange meetings on conduct  \nand culture in 2018, our people provided \nfeedback that they wanted more support \nunderstanding how pricing is determined \nto support conversations with customers \nand ensure consistency. New guidelines  \non pricing and transparency have  \nsince been agreed and published.\nReinforcing our controls \nframework \n –During 2018, our businesses ran \nexercises to encourage a deeper \nunderstanding of the conflicts of interest \nthat can occur in investment banking. \nThese captured a more granular view of \nthe potential situations that our people \nneed to be aware of and actively manage. \nOver 100 workshops have been held to \ncreate an inventory of conflicts of interest \nthat could arise within GB&M, bringing \nbusiness lines and regions together. \n –We reviewed all our Global Banking \nlocations to assess whether they are \nsegregated from other business lines  \nfrom the perspective of information \ncontrol and managing conflicts of interest.\n –We work in an environment where we are \nentrusted with privileged information that \nwe have a critical responsibility to protect. \nIt is vital that high levels of information \ncontrols are in place. Improvements in \ncontrols and procedures have been \nintroduced during 2018. Over 31,000 \nHSBC employees across all GB&M offices \ncompleted a bespoke training module on \ninformation control procedures.\n For further information on our approach to conduct \nand the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.GB&M annual complaint volumes1\n2018 2017\nGlobal Markets2201 273\nGlobal Banking 330 417\nSecurities Services 360 349\nGlobal Liquidity and \nCash Management3 1,251 474\nTotal 2,142 1,513 1.

However, the \ncustomer engagement survey highlighted how some customers do not feel their feedback is addressed properly. In response, \nwe are improving how we record feedback to ensure this is addressed in a more systematic way. \nWe have three global strategic investment programmes underway focused on improving customer engagement and supporting \nsustainable business growth. These programmes, overseen by the GPB executive committee, are in the following table:We serve the needs of high net worth \nand ultra high net worth individuals and \nfamilies, helping them to grow, manage \nand preserve their personal wealth from \ngeneration to generation.\nBuilding strong personal relationships \nwith customers is critical in private \nbanking. Our customer service teams, \ncomprising relationship managers, \ninvestment counsellors, product and \ncredit specialists, and wealth planners \ninteract with customers on a daily basis, \nlistening to and acting on feedback.\nCustomer satisfaction\nIn addition to this feedback, we conduct \nan annual customer engagement survey. \nIn 2018, more than 800 customers \nshared their views on our people, \nproducts and services. Our overall \nsatisfaction score fell from 8.4 to 7.6 (based on a scale of 1 to 10), falling  \nshort of our threshold target of 8.0. This \ndecline corresponded with a decline in \nour customers’ perception of whether  \nwe offer value for money, falling from \n91% to 76%.\nHowever, our customers continue  \nto be satisfied with our relationship \nmanagement teams, scoring them  \n8.4 out of 10, while 86% strongly agree \nthat our portfolio reviews meet their \nfinancial needs, by providing a score  \nof either 4 or 5 (on a scale of -5 to 5). Our Global Private Banking \ncustomers \nThe three themes that have emerged \nfrom this survey, which we need to \naddress are: \n –We need to improve perceptions of  \nthe quality of investment advice and \nproducts, which is falling short of \nexpectations. \n –We need to keep pace with increasing \ncustomer expectations. We have been \nslow to implement a global digital \nproposition and our customers have \nexperienced a higher number of \ninstances than is acceptable where  \nthe service they have received from  \nus left them feeling annoyed or  \nlet down. \n –We need to change outdated \nprocesses. Some of our customers  \nfeel our processes and procedures are \ncumbersome, and as a consequence \nwe may not be easy to deal with.\nArea of focus Action\nAdvisory services We are enhancing our advisory proposition through investment in technology that provides more sophisticated \nportfolio construction and risk analytics capabilities. This should help us to improve our investment processes \nand provide more proactive, well-informed advice. To support this, we increased the number of customer-\nfacing investment professionals and product specialists by 17% in 2018, and plan to make further investments \nin 2019, including a comprehensive training programme.\nDigital We are aware that our investment in digital wealth management capabilities has lagged behind those of  \nour competitors. This has had an adverse impact on customer satisfaction. In 2018, we developed online  \nand app-based capabilities that went live initially in the UK in February 2019 and which will be introduced  \nto all our key markets during the year.

The significant \nmajority (77%) related to service and \nadministration issues, which include \ninvestment reporting, delay or failure  \nto process customer instructions, \ndissatisfaction with postal or online \nservices, and record updating.

Senior leaders  \nset the tone and recently supported a \nseries of workshops for colleagues in  \nour European booking centres. These \nincluded real conduct case studies for \nsenior management and supervisors  \nto discuss with their teams, and will \ncontinue in 2019 to maintain the  \ncurrent level of focus.\nStrengthening our controls \nSince 2015, we have published  \na number of conduct-related policies, \nincluding those addressing conflicts of \ninterest, best execution, sales suitability, \npricing, product governance, the \nsupervisory framework and potentially \nvulnerable customers.\nWe continue to focus on ensuring these \nare embedded and applied consistently \nacross the business. Ongoing work to \nstrengthen controls includes: –Sales suitability: We established sales \nquality assurance (‘SQA’) teams in  \n2017, enabling us to focus on improving \nthe quality and consistency of our \ninvestment advice. In 2018, more than \n3,200 trades were sample tested, 93% \nof which provided advice in line with  \nour standards, with identified issues \nresulting in appropriate remedial action \nincluding customer contact where \nnecessary. The SQA teams also perform \nthematic reviews, focusing on high risk \nscenarios. Where deviations from the \nstandards or issues are identified, they \nare escalated and corrective action is \ntaken, where required. \n –Supervisory framework: We defined a \nnew framework in 2018, establishing \nclear standards and guidelines for \nindividuals with responsibility for \nsupervising customer-facing employees. \n –Product governance and pricing: We \nstrengthened our product governance in 2018 with increased global oversight. \nOur product pricing principles, set by a \nglobal pricing policy and fair value \nexchange criteria for specific asset \nclasses, are being embedded in all \nbooking centres. \nTraining our people  \nfor fair outcomes\nThrough the ongoing deployment of \nrole-based learning, all customer-facing \nteams completed conduct training as \nrequired by their role in 2018. Building  \non this, we developed specific learning \nprogrammes for people managers  \nand supervisors. This training develops \ncapabilities to supervise, coach and \ndevelop relationship managers, \ninvestment counsellors and customer \nservice executives within GPB. \n For further information on our approach to conduct \nand the steps we have taken, see pages 37 to 39.\n17\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Our Global Private Banking customers\nWe are committed to improving customer \nexperience through investments in \ntechnology. Here we highlight some  \nof our areas of focus during 2018.\nImproving customer experience\nWe are investing in technology to get  \nto know our customers better and make \nuse of these insights to provide them  \nwith clarity about their finances. Digital \nmessaging is used to help our UK \ncustomers with financial difficulties \nmanage their debt, including accessing \ndebt consolidation services and charities \nonline. Since launching this new service  \nin November 2018, we have received \nmore than 17,000 visits. \nFor our global and institutional customers, \nwe became one of the first banks in 2018 \nto roll out Face ID login globally. The Live \nChat service on HSBCnet is now available \nto more than 56,000 customers in six \ncountries. It has consistently high customer \nsatisfaction ratings, reaching 89% in July \n2018. We were also the first foreign bank  \nin mainland China to allow customers to \naccess services through WeChat.\nMobile banking experience\nWe have seen significant growth in \nmobile adoption rates for our retail \ncustomers, with the proportion of mobile \nactive customers increasing by almost \n50% in 2018. We have introduced new \nmobile app features, such as remote \ncheque deposit in the UK and Canada, \nmobile chat in the UK, and International \nEducation Payment Solution (‘IEPS’) in \nChina, which allows customers to pay for \ntheir children’s international education \nfees from their mobile phones. \nOur PayMe mobile app allows HSBC \ncustomers and non-customers to send  \nand receive money instantly and for free. \nPayMe has approximately 1.5 million \nusers with over two million payments \nmade each month, making it the number \none peer-to-peer payments app in Hong \nKong, according to the Hong Kong \nMonetary Authority. \nIn 2018, we launched new mobile apps in \nfive markets, with improved functionality such as biometric login and the ability  \nto put temporary blocks on cards. As  \nwe continue our roll-out of new apps, \napproximately 20% of active mobile users \nstill use the legacy app, which lacks some \nfeatures users expect. This can be seen \nthrough low Apple App store ratings, \nwhere our legacy mobile app scores an \naverage 1.9 out of 5 compared with the \nnew app scoring 4.8 in the UK and  \n4.7 in Hong Kong.\nOur new Business Express mobile app \nhelps enable our commercial customers  \nto stay on top of their business finances \nany time, anywhere. Key features include \nbiometric access through fingerprint  \nor facial recognition, fast and accurate \ntracking of recent incoming funds, \noutgoing payments as well as all trade \ntransactions, plus instant help from the \nchatbot Ask Amy 24/7. New features will \nbe added, including notifications and \nfaster payment journeys. \nMachine learning/AI\nArtificial intelligence (‘AI’) and machine \nlearning are becoming easier to use \nthrough our adoption of cloud computing, \nopen source frameworks and commercial \nsolutions. AI is being used to better \nsegment customers for financial crime \ndetection and to investigate potential \ncrime faster and to a higher quality. \nMachine learning is at the heart of our \nintelligence-led financial crime models, \nwhere it is being trialled to improve \nreal-time detection rates and reduce  \nfalse positives. AI is also being used \nincreasingly within our RBWM business  \nto determine customer needs, and to \nenable us to make relevant offers to our \ncustomers at the right time for them.\nFor our retail customers, we introduced \nmachine learning-enabled chatbots in \nmainland China, Hong Kong and the  \nUS to handle basic questions so that \ncustomers would not need to wait for  \na live agent to be available. \nFor our global and institutional clients,  \nour virtual assistant uses machine learning \nto answer customers’ questions.

In \nresponse, we are investing in business \nand technical controls to help prevent, \ndetect and react to these cyber threats.   \nWe are strengthening our controls to \nhelp protect against advanced malware, \ndata leakage, infiltration of payment \nsystems and denial of service attacks  \nas well as enhancing our ability to  \ndetect and respond to cyber-attacks.  \nAn important part of our defence \nstrategy is ensuring our employees \nremain cyber-aware and know how to \nreport incidents. We continually evaluate \nthe threat environment for the most \nprevalent attack types and their potential \noutcomes in order to determine the most \neffective controls. \nWe operate a three lines of defence \nmodel, aligned to the operational risk \nmanagement framework, to identify, \nreport and manage cyber risks within  \nthe organisation. Global business and \nfunction risk owners in the first line are \naccountable for identifying, owning and \nmanaging the cyber risk. They work with \ncontrol owners to help ensure controls \nare in place to mitigate issues, prevent \nrisk events occurring and resolve risk \nevents if they do occur. These controls \nare executed in line with policies \nproduced by the second line information \nsecurity risk teams and are overseen by \nthe third line – the independent Internal \nAudit function. \nCyber risk and control effectiveness  \nwas reviewed 11 times at non-executive \nDirector level, including by the Board, \nGroup Risk Committee and Group Audit \nCommittee. It is also reported across the \nglobal businesses, functions and regions \nto help ensure appropriate visibility  \nand governance of the risk and its \nmitigating controls.\nWe participate in several industry bodies \nand working groups to discuss cyber \nrisks, including the following: –attendee of key banking association \ncyber working groups in all regions, \nincluding groups run by the Association \nfor Financial Markets in Europe and the \nHong Kong Association of Banks;\n –contributor to the UK’s National Cyber \nSecurity Centre, specifically through \nthe Cyber Security Information Sharing \nPartnership initiative;\n –member of the following three chapters \nof the Financial Services Information \nSharing and Analysis Center: the  \nUS, UK and Europe, and Asia-Pacific \nchapters; \n –member of the Institute of International \nFinance cyber working group;\n –contributor to the Cyber Security \nIndustry Group, a financial services \nindustry-led information exchange \nforum in the UK; and\n –member of government-led computer \nemergency response teams in major \nmarkets, including the UK, US and \nHong Kong.\nOperational resilience\nOperational resilience is the ability  \nto adapt operations to continue \nfunctioning when – not if – circumstances \nchange. We have a clear strategic \napproach to operational resilience \nconsidered from three perspectives,  \nwhile putting the impact on our \ncustomers and colleagues at the centre  \nof our thinking: how we architect, design \nand build systems and services; how  \nwe operate, run and monitor our control \nenvironment; and how we respond and \nrecover in the event of disruption.  \nData privacy\nWe are committed to protecting the \nprivacy of data we hold and process,  \nin accordance with the laws and \nregulations of the geographies we operate \nin. We are focused on embedding a \nculture designed to ensure data privacy  \nis at the heart of our organisation.In 2018, there were significant changes  \nto EU data privacy laws, with the General \nData Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) \ncoming into effect across the EU, while \nnew data privacy legislation came into \nforce in some non-EU jurisdictions. The \nintroduction of the GDPR provided us with \nan opportunity to review and reinforce our \ndata privacy policies and controls across \nthe Group, giving customers, employees \nand stakeholders more transparency and \ncontrol over how we use and manage \ntheir information. A dedicated programme \nof work was mobilised to execute and \nembed GDPR requirements within HSBC \nahead of its coming into force. We \ncontinue to develop and focus our privacy \ncapabilities in areas such as safeguards, \nprivacy impact and risk assessments, staff \ntraining, education and raising awareness. \nData privacy is regularly reported at \nmultiple Group-level governance forums, \nwhich include Board level representation \nto help ensure appropriate challenge  \nand visibility among senior stakeholders. \nIn addition, data privacy governance \nstructures have been established within \nthe Group. We continue to work towards \nembedding ownership and accountability \nof data governance across all businesses \nand functions in an effort to ensure \neffective management of risks.\nIncreasing complexity in the matrix  \nof global data privacy laws, recent \ndevelopments in data localisation \nrequirements and the emergence of  \nnew data-driven technologies continue  \nto challenge the banking industry. They \nalso bring opportunities to serve our \ncustomers better, and we recognise that \ndata privacy and concepts such as privacy \nby design are fundamental to achieving \nthis. We continue to work closely with \ndata privacy regulators, industry bodies \nand external stakeholders around the \nworld to stay abreast of regulatory \ndevelopments in this area.

The adjacent table shows \nselected results from our 2018 survey.\nSnapshot survey\nWe track employee advocacy by asking \nwhether our people would recommend \nHSBC as a great place to work. Currently, \n66% of our people would recommend \nHSBC, an increase from 64% in 2017.  \nWe recognise there is more to do and  \nwe are aiming to improve this measure  \nby three points each year through to  \n2020. Analysis in 2018 showed us that \ntrust in leadership, career development \nand recognising our people for their \nbehaviour and performance drive a \npositive response to this question. \nIn late 2018, we expanded our Snapshot \nsurvey to look at behaviours by asking  \nif people see others demonstrating  \nour values. The feedback allows us to \nidentify areas for improvement and  \ntake meaningful action in 2019. \nWe see that 74% of our people feel able  \nto speak up when they see behaviour that \nthey consider to be wrong. It tells us that \nour speak-up channels are working, but  \nwe know there is further work to be done. Exchange \nOur Exchange forums provide a place for \nour people to share their open and honest \nviews. Typically, these are meetings held \nwithout an agenda, meaning people can \ndiscuss what matters most to them. We \nknow that when people participate in \nExchange meetings, they feel more able to speak up, have more trust in leadership \nand report higher levels of well-being. \nMore than half of our people took part  \nin an Exchange meeting during 2018. \nOver 2,000 Exchange meetings were \narranged to discuss our ambition to  \ncreate the healthiest human system in our \nindustry.

In 2018, more than 720,000 recognitions were made  \nto a total value of $8.4 million. In 2018, we focused on HSBC sustainability, resulting in over 65,000 employee recognitions. \nStories were shared as inspirational case studies on our intranet, HSBC NOW.

However, we \nunderstand that in some circumstances \npeople prefer a more discreet way to \nraise their concerns.  \nWhistleblowing \nHSBC Confidential is a global platform \nthat allows people to raise concerns \noutside of our normal reporting and \nescalation channels in confidence  \nand without fear of retaliation. This  \nis available to all of our people, past  \nand present, in all global businesses, \nfunctions and entities.\nWithin this platform, we have  \nmultiple channels to raise issues,  \nincluding telephone hotlines, online \nportals and email. A broad range of  \ncases, covering a range of severity  \nlevels, are dealt with each year. We also \nmonitor an external email address for \nconcerns about accounting, internal \nfinancial controls or auditing matters  \n(accountingdisclosures@hsbc.com).  \nIn 2019, we plan to expand our use of  \nan independent third-party supplier to \nmanage our 24/7 reporting hotline and \nensure the service is available in the \nGroup’s key local languages. \nWe rely on our people to deliver fair \noutcomes for our customers and make \nsure we act with integrity in the financial \nmarkets. A high standard of personal \nconduct is critical for our ability to live  \nup to this commitment and ensure  \na healthy working environment for  \nour people. We actively manage \nmisconduct by taking any necessary \naction, up to and including dismissal.  \nWe monitor and report cases on  \na regular basis to management All whistleblowing concerns are subject \nto an independent investigation, which  \nis carried out by teams trained to handle \nsensitive cases. These include human \nresources, compliance, legal, information \nsecurity and internal audit. Cases are \nallocated depending on the concerns \nraised. In 2018, 74% related to people, \n12% to security and fraud, 11% to \ncompliance, and the remaining 3% to \nother categories. Following investigation, \nwe take appropriate action if necessary, \nincluding disciplinary action or \nadjustments to variable pay and/or \nperformance and behaviour ratings.   \nWe learn lessons and change our \nprocesses where needed. \nHSBC does not condone or tolerate \nretaliation against people who raise \nconcerns and we strictly enforce  \nour policy relating to this.

We extended our Accelerating \nFemale Leaders programme in our  \nGB&M business to include our CMB and \nGPB businesses.

We have complied with  \nthe regulations and reported our 2017/2018 GPG. Our UK gender pay gap is \ndriven by the gender imbalance within our businesses and functions. There  \nare fewer women in senior leadership roles, meaning that we have more men \nearning higher salaries. A higher proportion of women work in more junior  \nroles or work part-time hours. \nWe are committed to improving gender balance and are taking a number  \nof specific steps that we expect to have a positive impact in the UK over  \ntime, including:\n –driving better gender balance at all levels in the organisation;\n –developing female talent to strengthen the leadership pipeline; \n –supporting families and flexibility; and \n –retaining female talent.\nWe are confident in our approach to pay and where we have identified pay \ndifferences that cannot be explained, we have made appropriate adjustments.\n1.

While \nwe have taken action, we know there is \nmore to do. \nIn October 2018, we held over 75 events \nto support World Mental Health Day. \nThis included a video interview between \nJohn Flint, our Group Chief Executive, \nand Brian Heyworth, our Global Head of \nClient Strategy, sharing their perspectives \non mental health at HSBC. This has \nbecome one of the most viewed internal \nvideos and helped open the conversation \nwithin HSBC.\nWe offer an employee assistance \nprogramme so our people have free \naccess to external expert assistance and \nconfidential advice when they require it, \nsuch as after suffering a bereavement or \npersonal difficulty. We advertise these \nthird-party programmes locally so our \npeople have the available information  \nto get the best support. \nWe use our learning platform, HSBC \nUniversity, to publish articles and \nresources relating to mental health  \nfrom industry-leading bodies. \nIn 2019, we will start to provide \nwidespread mental health education  \nand support to our people, starting with  \na programme of mental health education \nfor all managers. Our focus will be on \nspotting the signs of mental ill-health, \nhaving open conversations and \nsignposting the right support. This will  \nbe supported by local and Group-wide \nawareness campaigns, recognising that \nwe all have a part to play to create a  \nmore open environment. \nFlexible working\nOur 2017 global well-being survey \nconfirmed that 49% of our people work flexibly, and those who do are more \npositive about their general well-being. \nWe know this is an area where people \nwant more support, so during 2018 we \ninvested in technology and infrastructure. \nWe expanded an OpenWork concept, \nwhich makes it easier for our people to \nwork flexibly across 27 cities covering \napproximately 75,000 staff. This helped \nmore of our people make positive choices \nthat meet their needs both inside and \noutside of work. \nOne of our HSBC Communities, Flex, \nwhich supports flexible working, has  \nrun global events on topics such as job \nsharing. These included an event on \nInternational Men’s Day, which focused \non male employees and the mental health \nbenefits of flexible working. Our priority \nfor 2019 is to implement consistent \nflexible working principles across HSBC.\nFinancial well-being\nIn 2018, we re-launched our employee \nassistance programmes, to include \nfinancial support. In addition, multiple \ncountries have run financial capability \nevents, including Mexico, UAE and the UK.\nIn 2019, we are enhancing the content and \nroll-out of our events and education as we \nrecognise there is further action needed. \n For more information on how we are working to \nincrease financial capability, see pages 11 and 34.  \nLearning and development\nTalent development \nWe recognise we must invest in our \npeople to continue to thrive. \nThe International Manager Programme is \none of our flagship talent programmes. \nWith approximately 300 international \nmanagers currently deployed across  \n46 countries, the programme provides \nresourcing flexibility and helps us develop \na strong pipeline of home-grown future \nleaders for our most critical positions. \nInternational mobility is key to future \nsuccess. We offer international \nsecondments and transfers to our wider \nemployee base, which enhances career \ndevelopment opportunities, and helps to attract, develop and motivate our people \nwho demonstrate high potential.\nExpanding HSBC University \nThe opportunity to develop is one of  \nthe most important factors affecting  \nhow people feel about HSBC. We \ncelebrated the first anniversary of our \nhome of learning, HSBC University,  \nin November 2018. Thousands of \nresources are available through this \nplatform, which receives more than \n52,000 visits per month. \nHSBC University strengthens how  \nwe learn and lead through new \nprogrammes, resources and premises. \nWe have launched HSBC University \nregional hubs at our offices in Dubai  \nand the HSBC UK headquarters in \nBirmingham, providing opportunities  \nfor our colleagues, customers and \ncommunity groups to come together  \nto learn, develop and connect.\nWe have expanded our management  \nand leadership development with new \nprogrammes, including Leading with \nImpact for senior leaders, and Leading \nMyself for those without a team. We have \ndeveloped our Essentials programme to \nsupport people managers and strengthen \ntheir coaching and hiring skills. In 2018, \n600 leaders completed the Leaders as \nTeachers programme and put their skills \ninto practice by supporting colleagues’ \ntraining through business programmes, \nLeadership Essentials and the Accelerated \nDevelopment Programme.\nWe are committed to helping our  \npeople prepare for the future of work.  \nWe launched digital skills training, and  \nour Leading Myself programme explored \nareas including personal resilience, \ncollaboration and communicating with \nimpact. This is a continued area of focus  \nas there is more to do. \nDuring 2018, we formed partnerships with \nexternal providers, including LinkedIn \nLearning and Coursera, and introduced \nlearning modules to raise awareness of \nour sustainability challenges. \n For further details on how we are building \nfuture skills, see page 34.\n25\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nEurope56%\nAsia28%\nAmericas13%\nMiddle East, North \nAfrica and Turkey3%Target Progress\nProgress TargetAt a glance\nOur relationship\nOur actions have an impact on the \ncommunities where we do business \nand the wider environment.

We \nare one of the biggest issuers for green, \nsocial and sustainable (‘GSS’) bonds. In \n2018, we were the number one issuer of \nsustainable bonds globally and number \ntwo for GSS bonds overall, according  \nto data provider Dealogic. In 2018, we \nwere recognised by Euromoney  as the \nBest Bank for Sustainable Finance in \nAsia for our efforts to innovate products \nto address customers’ evolving needs.\nExtel ranked us top for climate change \nresearch for a fifth consecutive year  \nin 2018. In addition, our businesses \nprovided a number of reports to help \ninform customers on sustainability \nconsiderations, including Low-carbon \ntransition scenarios: Exploring scenario \nanalysis for equity valuations  by HSBC \nAsset Management, and Sustainability \nguidebook for treasurers  by Global \nLiquidity and Cash Management.\nWe held over 2,500 customer meetings \nin 2018 for our largest clients in GB&M \nand CMB to discuss sustainable finance \noptions and opportunities. We are \nbuilding the knowledge and capabilities \nof our people through continued training \nand engagement. We introduced a  \nnew series of learning modules on \nsustainability through our online HSBC \nUniversity for all employees, as well as \ntailored sustainability training sessions \nfor key customer-facing employees and \npeople in risk management roles. More \nthan 2,300 employees participated in \ntargeted sustainable finance training.Driving market innovation \nWe look for opportunities to develop \nand expand the market for sustainable \nfinance, and contributed to a number of \nmarket precedents in 2018. HSBC acted \nas sole green structuring adviser for the \nRepublic of Indonesia’s green Islamic \nbond, known as a sukuk, which marked \nthe first sovereign green sukuk (see the \ncase study on the following page).\nWe played an active role in the \ndevelopment of the Green Loan \nPrinciples introduced in 2018 and \nengaged with customers to provide \nlending that conforms to these industry-\nrecognised guidelines. We acted as  \nthe sole green finance adviser and joint \nmandated lead arranger and bookrunner \nfor the first green loan in Hong Kong. We \nalso launched a lending scheme in Hong \nKong that allows customers to earn cash \nrewards for making carbon savings.\nDemonstrating leadership\nWe are helping lead the development of \nthe sustainable finance market through \nour own actions. In 2018, we issued the \nworld’s first sukuk linked to the United \nNation’s Sustainable Development  \nGoals (‘SDGs’) with the help of our \nIslamic banking arm in Malaysia. See \nwww.hsbc.com/investors/fixed-income-\ninvestors/green-and-sustainability-bonds \nfor the impact reports related to our \ngreen and sustainability bonds. We \npublished 25 reports in the inaugural \nyear of HSBC’s Centre of Sustainable \nFinance, which was launched in 2018  \nto provide sustainability-related thought \nleadership and innovation. These efforts \naim to strengthen understanding and \ndebate across the financial industry  \nand among other stakeholders. Further opportunities\nWe recognise the potential we have as a \nglobal universal bank to help facilitate the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy and \nsupport other sustainability goals. As  \nwe continue to develop our programme  \nof initiatives, we see particular \nopportunities to help our customers \nembed sustainability throughout their \nsupply chains and to work with more \ncarbon-intensive industries to respond  \nto climate change challenges.\nOur HSBC Navigator survey, which  \npolls over 8,500 businesses in 34 \nmarkets on the global business \nenvironment, included a focus in 2018 on \ntrade and sustainability. Nearly one-third \nof businesses surveyed plan to make \nsustainability-related changes to their \nsupply chains within the next three years. \nThe survey identified financial gain, cost \nefficiency and sustainability goals as \nprimary drivers for these changes. We \naim to expand our efforts to provide \nworking capital and term lending \nsolutions that facilitate sustainability \npractices along supply chains.Sustainable business\n#2\nDealogic ranking for green, social and \nsustainability bond issuer, both globally  \nand in Asia in 2018\n27\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nCase study: The first green loan for UK \ncommercial buildings\nDirect greenhouse gas emissions from buildings in the UK \naccount for 19% of the country’s total, and improving the \nenergy efficiency within this sector will be key to the UK \nmeeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement. That  \nis why green and retrofit buildings are critical to cutting \ngreenhouse gases. We have been working with Argent,  \na UK property developer, on this issue. In 2018, HSBC UK \nacted as the green coordinator, mandated lead arranger  \nand hedging counterparty for the first green loan for UK \ncommercial buildings. The £400 million green loan facility, \nwhich is helping Argent fund the development of two office \nbuildings, is compliant with the Loan Market Association’s \nand Asia Pacific Loan Market Association’s Green Loan \nPrinciples. The offices have been designed with \nsustainability features that will bring the carbon footprint \ndown to approximately 50% of similar offices in the country \nand are both targeting BREEAM Outstanding – one of the \nhighest levels of green building certification globally.As part of our drive to deliver growth from areas of strength, we are committed to helping our clients transition  \nto a low-carbon economy, supporting the achievement of the SDGs, and supporting positive societal impacts. \nCumulative progress through 2018\nSince the start of 2017, we have achieved $28.5bn of our commitment to provide and facilitate $100bn of sustainable financing \nand investment by 2025.

This can be \nfound on our website www.hsbc.com/our-approach/measuring-our-impact.Sustainable business continued\nCase study: The first green sovereign sukuk\nIn 2009, the Republic of Indonesia was among the  \nfirst countries to voluntarily set carbon emission targets \nduring international negotiations in Copenhagen. Under \nthe Paris Agreement, the country pledged to reduce \nemissions by up to 41% by 2030 and recently adopted  \nthe green sukuk framework to support its commitment. \nTo fund climate mitigation and adaption projects in a \nbroad range of sectors, as well as to demonstrate its \ncommitment to the Paris Agreement, Indonesia issued \nthe world’s first green Islamic bond, known as a sukuk, \nfor $1.25 billion in February 2018. HSBC acted as joint \nlead manager, joint bookrunner and sole green \nstructuring adviser. This transaction represented the  \nfirst sovereign green sukuk, the first international green \noffering by an Asian sovereign and the first Asian \nsovereign green bond focused on Paris Agreement \nambitions. \n28\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Supporting sustainable growth | Sustainable finance\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy \nwill occur over a multi-year horizon and  \nit will take time for sectors currently \ndependent on fossil fuels to adapt. While \nit is acknowledged there should be a \nsignificant and immediate reduction in \nthe use of coal to generate power, other \ntraditional sources of energy, such as oil \nand gas, have a longer term role during \nthe transition. Developing countries may \nalso need more time to adjust as they \nbalance sometimes competing \nsustainable development goals.\nIn this context, we are working to  \nfurther understand the specific risks  \nand opportunities climate change \npresents to our customers, and we are \ndeveloping our knowledge and capacity \nto support their transition towards a  \nmore sustainable future. We are doing  \nthis through our engagement in the \nEnergy Transitions Commission,  \nthought leadership articles published  \non the Centre of Sustainable Finance  \n(www.sustainablefinance.hsbc.com),  \nand other industry engagement.\nIn 2018, we developed a transition  \nrisk questionnaire with some of our \ncustomers to improve our understanding \nof their climate transition strategies.  \nThis is helping us to identify which \ncustomers need to adapt rapidly to \nclimate-related risks, and spot potential \nbusiness opportunities. In time, this \ninformation can be incorporated into an \ninitial assessment of transition risk within \nour credit risk management processes. \nWe plan to roll the questionnaire out more widely in 2019. We have also \nembedded climate risk more broadly  \nin our risk management processes.  \nMore information can be found in  \nthe risk management section of  \nour TCFD disclosure on page 30.\nAnother important element of our climate \nrisk management is covered via our \nsustainability risk management strategy. \nSustainability risk is broader than climate \nrisk. We define it as the risk that financial \nservices provided to customers by the \nGroup indirectly result in unacceptable \nimpacts on people or the environment. \nGroup Sustainability Risk, which is part of \nthe Global Risk function, is responsible for \nmanaging our sustainability risk policies \n(covering agricultural commodities, \nchemicals, defence, energy, forestry, \nmining and metals, UNESCO World \nHeritage sites, and Ramsar-designated \nwetlands) and our application of the \nEquator Principles. As with climate risk \nmanagement, we seek to partner with  \nour customers to improve their operating \nstandards. For more information on  \nhow we manage sustainability risk, see \nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\nOur energy policy\nOur approach is to support our \ncustomers to transition to a low-carbon \neconomy while limiting the financing of \nhigh-carbon intensity energy projects. In \n2018, we updated our energy policy and \nset out our position with respect to new \nproject financing of coal-fired power, Our approach to climate risk management  \nEngaging with our customers on palm oil\nPalm oil is the world’s main vegetable oil. It requires less  \nland per output than other vegetable oils, and its production \ncan bring wide economic benefits. However, when produced \nunsustainably, palm oil can lead to deforestation, resulting  \nin threats to endangered species, social conflict and  \nclimate change. \nWe have worked closely with our customers to support \ncertification through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm  \nOil (‘RSPO’), an independent organisation that sets standards \nof good practice against which companies are independently \ncertified. Internally, we have progressively raised our own \npolicy standards. In 2014, we decided we would only finance \ncustomers that were already partly certified under RSPO and \naimed to complete certification by the end of 2018. Customers \nalso need to provide evidence of independent verification \nunder their commitments to ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, and \nNo Exploitation’ (‘NDPE’). Our agricultural commodities policy \nis available online at www.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.A number of our customers have chosen to operate \nsustainably as a result of our engagement, including  \n11 customers that have introduced NDPE policies  \nfollowing discussions with HSBC. At the end of 2018: \n –We financed 22 customers engaged in palm oil  \nproduction that have either met our policy or will do so \nshortly. Several customers are in the final stages of full \ncertification, managing external delays and resource \nconstraints to meet our specific requirements.\n –We have 31 customers who have operations in the palm  \noil sector, but where we do not finance this part of their \nbusiness. We have engaged with those customers and \nmany operate to or are working towards good practice.  \n –We have 19 customers that do not meet our policy,  \nand we intend to discontinue the relationship when  \nexisting loans have been repaid.  greenfield projects in the oil sands, \noffshore Arctic drilling and due diligence \nrequirements.\nOur energy policy is available online at \nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk.\nHSBC’s exposure to coal mining\nIn 2016, we updated our mining and \nmetals policy, so that we no longer \nfinance new thermal coal mines or new \ncustomers dependent on thermal coal \nmining. We also committed to publicly \nreport on our exposure to the coal mining \nsector. At 31 December 2018, our \nexposure to coal mining was $0.8bn, \nunchanged from a year earlier. This \nrepresents 4% of our total exposure to \nthe mining and metals sector in 2018. \nWe have adopted a new methodology  \nfor the identification of exposures to  \nthe metals and mining sector in order  \nto align with our TCFD disclosure. The \nmethodology is explained in footnote 37 \non page 67 of the Annual Report and \nAccounts 2018 .\nEquator Principles in 2018\nUnder the terms of the Equator Principles, \nwe report annually on the transactions \ncompleted under the Principles. In 2018, \nwe undertook 18 transactions under  \nthe Principles, compared with 20 in 2017. \nA detailed summary of our transactions  \nand implementation can be found at \nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/risk-and-\nresponsibility/sustainability-risk/equator-\nprinciples.\n29\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Sustainable finance\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’)\nWe all have a role to play in limiting \nclimate change and supporting the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy,  \nand we are a signatory to the disclosure \nrecommendations by the Financial \nStability Board’s task force. This \nrepresents our second disclosure  \nunder the framework. \nGovernance\nMitigating climate change is a key \npriority for our senior leadership, with \nsustainable finance metrics included in \nthe Group’s strategic priorities. In 2018, \nthere were two presentations on \nsustainability to the HSBC Holdings \nBoard, two to the Group Audit \nCommittee, four to the Group Risk \nCommittee, and two to the HSBC Group \nManagement Board. Senior leadership \nhave engaged with regulators, industry \nassociations and non-governmental \norganisations on this topic, such  \nas through the Bank of England \nconsultation on climate change, the \nGroup Chairman’s participation in the \nOne Planet Summit and the Group  \nChief Executive’s designation as a  \nWorld Economic Forum climate  \nleader. A summarised list of HSBC’s \nsustainability-related memberships is \navailable at: www.hsbc.com/our-\napproach/measuring-our-impact/\nsustainability-memberships.\nStrategy\nSupporting the transition to a low-carbon \neconomy is a key part of HSBC’s \nstrategy, and new products have been \noffered to facilitate this, along with a \npledge to provide $100bn of sustainable \nfinance by 2025. To date, we have \nreached $28.5bn of that goal. For further \ninformation, see pages 26 and 28. We \nrecognise many clients across sectors \nare making significant shifts towards the \nlow-carbon economy. During 2019, we \nintend to develop new metrics to help \nmeasure these activities, with an aim to \npublish in next year’s disclosure. \nWe believe education of our people  \nis crucial on this topic. We gave \nsustainability training to more than 2,300 \nemployees during 2018 and launched a \nsustainability online learning programme \nfor all employees globally, with content \ndeveloped in collaboration with the \nUniversity of Cambridge Institute for \nSustainability Leadership. We report on the emissions of our own \noperations via CDP (formerly the Carbon \nDisclosure Project). This is available, as \nwell as other information related to the \nsustainability of our own operations,  \nat: www.hsbc.com/our-approach/\nmeasuring-our-impact.\nRisk management\nWe are increasingly incorporating \nclimate-related risk, both physical and \ntransition, into how we manage and \noversee risks internally and with our \ncustomers. Climate risk is now included \nas a theme in our ‘Top and emerging \nrisks report’ to ensure that it receives \nmonthly management oversight via the \nRisk Management Meeting of the Group \nManagement Board (‘RMM’) (see page \n30 of our Annual Report and Accounts \n2018 ). In addition, our Board-approved \nrisk appetite statement contains a \nqualitative statement on our approach  \nto sustainability, which will be further \nexpanded in 2019 to include climate  \nrisk explicitly. \nWe have a number of sustainability risk \npolicies covering specific sectors. In 2018, \nwe updated our energy policy to limit the \nfinancing of high-carbon-intensity energy \nprojects, while still supporting energy \ncustomers on their transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. From the release of the \nnew energy policy in April 2018 until the \nend of 2018, HSBC financed no new \ncoal-fired power plants. \nTransition risk, in the context of climate \nchange, is the possibility that a customer’s \nability to meet its financial obligations will \ndeteriorate due to the global movement \nfrom a high-carbon to a low-carbon \neconomy. HSBC is working to embed transition risk into its day-to-day credit risk \nmanagement. The aim is that over time, \neach wholesale counterparty will receive \na client transition risk rating based on their \nsusceptibility to, and ability to manage, \ntransition risk. \nWe have identified six higher transition \nrisk sectors based on their contribution to \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions. These \nsectors are: oil and gas; building and \nconstruction; chemicals; automotive; \npower and utilities; and metals and \nmining. Over time we may identify \nadditional sectors as having higher \ntransition risk depending on a variety  \nof factors, including country-level  \ncarbon dioxide reduction plans per  \nthe Paris Agreement.\nThe table below presents our exposure  \nto the six higher transition risk sectors. \nThese figures capture all lending activity, \nincluding environmentally responsible \ncustomers and sustainable financing. \nFurther details on our approach to the \nquantification of exposures can be found \nin footnote 37 on page 67 of the Annual \nReport and Accounts 2018 . This is \nexpected to evolve over time as we \ndevelop new climate-related metrics.\nNext steps\nHSBC’s TCFD disclosures will continue \nto evolve and expand over time. In line \nwith TCFD recommendations, our \nAnnual Report and Accounts will start  \nto disclose the additional climate \nrisk-related metrics relating to our \nportfolio for specific sectors, as the \navailability of sufficient, reliable and \nrelevant customer data permits.\nSector% of total wholesale loans and advances to \ncustomers and banks in 201837\nOil and gas ≤ 3.9%\nBuilding and construction ≤ 3.8%\nChemicals ≤ 3.9%\nAutomotive ≤ 3.4%\nPower and utilities ≤ 3.0%\nMetals and mining ≤ 2.8%\nTotal ≤ 20.8%\nTotal wholesale loans and advances to customers and banks amount to $668bn. \n \nFor footnote 37, see page 67 of the Annual Report and Accounts 2018.\n30\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Supporting sustainable growth | Sustainable finance\nOur approach with our suppliers\nWe have globally consistent standards \nand procedures for the onboarding and \nuse of external suppliers. We require \nsuppliers to meet our compliance and \nfinancial stability requirements, as well  \nas to keep to our sustainability code  \nof conduct. Payment on time is of \nparamount importance, and as such our \ncommitment to paying our suppliers is in \nline with the UK Prompt Payment Code.\nSupplier ethical code  \nof conduct\nWe have an ethical and environmental \ncode of conduct for suppliers of goods \nand services, which must be complied \nwith by all suppliers. While our businesses \nand functions are accountable for  \nthe suppliers they use, our global \nprocurement function owns the code  \nof conduct review process for them. Our goal is to work collaboratively  \nwith our supply chain partners on \nsustainability at all times.

We also set \ntargets to increase recycling, procure \nelectricity from renewable sources and \ncommission buildings to the highest \nsustainability standards. In addition,  \nwe are working to enable sustainability \neducation for our people, engage with  \nour supply chains and fund pilot projects.

Middle East includes Turkey.Our renewable electricity challenge\nSince 2012, our renewable electricity strategy has evolved  \nfrom purchasing renewable energy credits to influencing the \nmarkets in which we operate by sourcing electricity through \npower purchase agreements (‘PPAs’) that provide additional \nrenewable energy to a country’s energy mix. In 2017, we \ncommitted to ensuring that 100% of our electricity was sourced \nfrom renewable sources by 2030, with an interim commitment  \nof 90% by 2025. Between 2012 and the end of 2018, we \ncontracted up to 29% of our electricity consumption through \nPPAs in various countries. As we strive to achieve our goal,  \nwe are conscious of the challenges this will present, such as  \nin some markets in Asia where PPAs are currently unavailable. \nWe are members of global initiatives, such as RE100, a  \nglobal initiative uniting more than 100 influential businesses \ncommitted to 100% renewable electricity, that aim to create  \na united corporate voice to influence countries’ policy to open \nmarkets. However, in some smaller Asian markets, our electricity \nconsumption is too small for projects to be economically viable, \nand therefore we will look to partner with other companies for  \na collaborative solution. By finding solutions to problems our \ncustomers and other companies face, we are in turn solving  \nour own similar challenges, and vice versa . \nOur waste challenge\nOur 2020 target was to reduce our total waste by 50% from our \n2011 baseline. This was achieved in 2015, and then stretched  \nto reduce by 75% from this 2011 baseline. At 2018, we had \nreduced total waste by 63%.\nOur recycling target is for 100% of our office and electronic \nwaste to be recycled by 2020. Since 2011, we have recycled \n61% of our office waste. \nWe are progressing well on our waste reduction target, however \nour recycling goal will be a challenge to achieve. As we continue \nto reduce our total waste, it becomes increasingly challenging to \nincrease or maintain recycling levels. \nWith differences within cities and buildings, we continue to \naddress the waste challenge by finding ways to reduce waste, \nsegregate and recycle. Most importantly, we continue to \nengage with our employees to better explain and further \neducate on local waste and recycling challenges.29%\nsigned renewable electricity from power purchase  \nagreements (2017: 27%)Achieving our operational goals continued\n33\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Sustainable operations\nWe have a responsibility to invest in  \nthe long-term prosperity of our global \ncommunities.

But it  \nis a challenge we must meet successfully. \nWe owe this not just to our customers and \nto society at large, but to our employees to \nensure they can be rightly proud of the \norganisation where they work. We aim to \nact with courageous integrity in all we do. \nThis guiding principle means having the \ncourage to make decisions based on doing \nthe right thing for customers and never \ncompromising our ethical standards  \nor integrity.\nWe have also sought to learn from past \nmistakes, such as the following three \nexamples, and we are seeking to develop \nand implement specific measures \ndesigned to prevent recurrence of similar \nevents in the future.\nAnti-money laundering  \nand sanctions\nBetween the 1990s and 2010, as \nacknowledged by HSBC in various \nagreements with US and UK authorities  \nin 2012, HSBC failed to implement \nappropriate anti-money laundering (‘AML ’) \nand sanctions controls. These oversight \nand control failures resulted in HSBC \nallowing at least $881 million in drug \nproceeds to be laundered through  \nHSBC into the US financial system and \napproximately $660 million in transactions \ninvolving sanctioned countries, such  \nas Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Libya and Burma,  \nto be processed, in violation of applicable \nUS laws.\nIn December 2012, HSBC entered into \nresolutions with, among others, the US \nDepartment of Justice (‘DoJ’) and the UK \nFinancial Services Authority (now the \nFinancial Conduct Authority, or FCA), \nregarding these past AML and sanctions-\nrelated failings. Under these agreements, \nwhich included a five-year deferred \nprosecution agreement with the DoJ  \n(‘the AML DPA’), HSBC made payments \ntotalling $1.9bn to US authorities and \nundertook various further obligations, \nincluding the retention of an independent \ncompliance monitor. Restoring trust  \nOver the past several years, we  \nhave radically restructured our global \noperations and significantly strengthened \nour ability to combat financial crime. \nWe recognise that we have a responsibility \nto help protect the integrity of the global \nfinancial system. In order to fulfil that \nresponsibility, we have made, and continue \nto make, significant investments in our \nability to detect, deter and prevent financial \ncrime. We have exited customers, \nproducts and countries where we deemed \nthe financial crime risk too high to manage. \nWe are also working with governments \nand other banks to advance our mutual \ninterests in this area. These steps are \nenabling us to much more effectively \nreduce the risk of financial crime.\nIn 2012, we launched our Global \nStandards initiative, focused on putting  \nin place the most effective standards to \ncombat financial crime across our \noperations globally. As part of this  \neffort, we designed and implemented \nnew, globally consistent policies on  \nAML and sanctions that often extend \nbeyond the requirements of local laws \nand regulations. Since 2013, we also \nestablished a Financial System \nVulnerabilities Committee (‘FSVC’)  \nto oversee our financial crime risk \nmanagement reforms. The FSVC reports  \nto the Board on matters relating to \nfinancial crime and financial system \nabuse, and provides a forward-looking \nperspective on financial crime risk, \nanti-bribery and corruption.\nAmong other steps, we hired experienced \nsenior personnel to lead the effort and \nsignificantly increased our financial crime \ncompliance capabilities; we put in place  \na robust investigations capability; we \nimproved and expanded our financial \ncrime compliance training initiatives;  \nand we upgraded or replaced key \ncompliance IT systems, with over  \n$1bn spent since 2015.Beyond these improvements, as part of \nour commitment to protect the integrity  \nof the financial system, and to do our part \nto fight financial crime, we continue to \nenhance our systems and are working to \nintegrate our reforms into our day-to-day \nrisk management practices so that our \nprogramme is effective and sustainable \nover the long term. We are also renewing \nour focus on anti-bribery and corruption \nas part of a dedicated three-year \nprogramme to advance the Group’s \nanti-bribery and corruption risk \nmanagement capability. As part of our \ncommitment to the UN Global Compact, \nwe have pledged to work against \ncorruption in all its forms, including \nextortion and bribery.\nThe AML DPA expired in December 2017, \nand we are pleased that our progress in \nstrengthening our AML and sanctions \ncompliance capabilities has been \nrecognised. Our work in this area will \ncontinue to be consistent with our \nstrategic priority of safeguarding our \ncustomers and delivering industry-leading \nfinancial crime standards.\nOver the coming years, we aim to evolve \nsignificantly our approach to financial \ncrime risk management by building \nadvanced analytical capabilities, \nincluding artificial intelligence, designed \nto help us target illicit conduct with \ngreater sophistication and precision.  \nThis will help us make a step change  \nin our effectiveness at fighting financial \ncrime and set a new standard that aims \nto lead the industry. We expect to be \nfaster and more accurate at detecting \npotential financial crime and ever more \ntargeted in our risk assessments. We \nexpect to generate actionable insight that \nwe can use ourselves and provide to law \nenforcement to help keep criminals out \nof the financial system. This will benefit \nthe Group, our customers and society  \nat large.\n For further information about our compliance \ninitiatives, see page 41.\n37\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nCustomer tax evasion \nPrior to 2011, our Swiss private bank \nprovided its customers with standard \nservices, common in the Swiss banking \nindustry at the time, which enabled \ncustomers to conceal their assets from \ntax authorities and avoid paying their \ntaxes. These services included, among \nother things, the opening of encoded \nnumbered accounts that kept the \naccount holder’s name confidential  \nand the provision of ‘hold mail’ services \nwhereby all mail was kept at the bank  \nfor customers to avoid receiving letters  \nat their domestic addresses. Our Swiss \nprivate bank, through certain of its \nrelationship managers, offered these \nservices while it had access to \ninformation enabling it to know, or  to suspect, that certain customers would \nuse those services in order to conceal \ntheir assets from tax authorities.\nWhile HSBC has reached agreements \nwith certain law enforcement authorities \nto resolve investigations relating to \nallegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, \nmoney laundering and unlawful cross-\nborder banking solicitation arising  \nout of these past practices, the Group \ncontinues to cooperate in ongoing \ninvestigations by other tax \nadministration, regulatory and law \nenforcement authorities around the \nworld in connection with similar \nallegations. We acknowledge that the \ncompliance culture and standards of due \ndiligence in our Swiss private bank were \nsignificantly lower in 2006 and 2007 than they are today. With hindsight, it is clear \nthat we maintained too many small and \nhigh-risk customer accounts and our \nprivate banking business was stretched \nover too many geographical markets,  \nall of which contributed to failings in \nstandards, culture and controls. \nIn recent years, our Global Private \nBanking (‘GPB’) business has taken \nsignificant steps to address these \nhistorical control weaknesses, most \nnotably in Switzerland. Beginning in \n2012, GPB developed a tax transparency \npolicy that included enhanced know your \ncustomer (‘KYC’) and AML procedures \nand a review of existing accounts against \npotential indicators of non-compliance \nwith tax obligations.

Furthermore, GPB discontinued \nits ‘hold mail’ service and has withdrawn \nfrom markets where it has been unable \nto conduct due diligence to a satisfactory \nstandard on its customers.\nAs a result of these reforms, the number \nof accounts and total customer assets  \nof GPB have been significantly reduced \nby this intensive de-risking exercise, \nwhere we have put compliance and  \ntax transparency ahead of profitability. \nWhere we used to offer banking services \nto customers in more than 140 countries, \nGPB now focuses on 34 strategic \nmarkets, with customer assets actively \nmanaged down by $140bn between \n2013 and 2018.\nWhile GPB has resolved a number  \nof legacy issues relating to the  \npast, investigations into former  \npractices are ongoing in a number  \nof countries at the time of publication.  \nIn addition, we acknowledge that  \nGPB’s role in providing financial  \nservices to high-profile individuals may \nsometimes result in GPB receiving  \nundue media attention.\n For further information about our Global Private \nBanking customers, see pages 16 and 17.Foreign exchange conduct\nPrior to 2013, our foreign exchange (‘FX’) \nbusiness lacked adequate governance, \noversight and risk management in order \nto ensure compliance with safe and \nsound banking practices and applicable \ninternal policies. As a result, we failed to \ndetect and address unsafe and unsound \nconduct by certain of our FX traders, \nwhich included the misuse of confidential \ninside information to conduct FX trades, \npossible agreements with traders of \nother institutions to coordinate FX trading \nand disclosure of confidential information \nto traders of other institutions. \nIn November 2014, HSBC agreed to \nregulatory settlements with the FCA  \nand the US Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission in connection with their \nrespective investigations of HSBC’s \ntrading and other conduct involving FX \nbenchmark rates. In September 2017, \nHSBC entered into a consent order with \nthe US Federal Reserve Board (‘FRB’)  \nin connection with its investigation into \nHSBC’s FX activities. Under the terms  \nof that order, HSBC agreed to undertake \ncertain remedial steps and to pay a civil \nmoney penalty to the FRB. In January \n2018, HSBC Holdings plc entered into  \na three-year deferred prosecution \nagreement with the DoJ (‘FX DPA’), \nregarding fraudulent conduct in \nconnection with two particular \ntransactions in 2010 and 2011. \nSince the historical conduct described  \nin these agreements, we have introduced \na number of measures designed to make \nthe control environment more robust  \nand prevent these failings from recurring \nin the future. We have dedicated,  \nand continue to dedicate, significant \nresources to strengthen our systems  \nand controls. While the investigations \nfocused specifically on our FX activity, \nthey have also given us good reason  \nto look again at other aspects of our \nconduct more broadly within the Global \nBanking and Markets (‘GB&M’) business. \nImprovements to our conduct agenda \nstarted more than four years ago and continue to this day. We are enhancing \nand accelerating progress made in \nstrengthening and remediating our \nsystems and controls and broader \ncompliance culture through a newly \nestablished GB&M Conduct Committee, \nled by our GB&M Chief Executive Officer. \nMarket experts are providing input.  \nThe agenda focuses on culture and \nbehaviours; customers, including \nsuitability, conflicts of interest, pricing \nand transparency; markets, covering \nmarket conduct, trade execution and \ncompetition; governance and controls; \nand strategy and business planning. \nProgress is being tracked and reported \nthrough our own governance channels, \nas well as being reported to the FRB,  \nDoJ and our regulators in line with our \nagreements with them all.\nConduct is core to how we operate  \nand manage our business. We have \nalready implemented improvements  \nto algorithmic trading to manage risk \naround benchmark orders, and updated \nour policies for sales, order handling, \nmanaging confidential customer \ninformation and conflicts of interest, \npre-hedging and market abuse. In 2018, \nwe introduced further improvements to \nthe management of sensitive information \nthrough physical barriers, technology \ncontrols and procedures. We have also \ncontinued to invest in enhancing our \nvoice, trade and electronic surveillance \ncapabilities across the globe to improve \nthe monitoring of telephone calls, instant \nmessages and trades to spot potentially \nimproper activity. Global and regional \nconduct governance forums have been \ncreated to provide supervision and \noversight over the implementation and \neffectiveness of our conduct agenda. An \nextensive plan is in place, and we aim to \ndeliver this as fast and efficiently as we \ncan. Our success will determine how well \nwe deliver the right outcomes for our \ncustomers and stakeholders, consistently \nand reliably, for many years to come.\n For further information about our  \nGlobal Banking and Markets customers,  \nsee pages 14 and 15.34\nstrategic markets that our GPB business \nfocuses on, down from more than 140 as  \na result of de-risking\n39\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019Restoring trust\nEnsuring strong  \ncorporate governance  \nWe are committed to high standards of \ncorporate governance across the Group. \nA comprehensive statement on our \ncorporate governance practices is set \nout on pages 152 to 213 of our Annual \nReport and Accounts 2018.\nThe role of the Board\nThe Board of HSBC Holdings plc aims to \npromote the Group’s long-term success, \ndeliver sustainable value to shareholders \nand promote a culture of openness and \ndebate. Led by the Group Chairman, the \nBoard sets the Group’s strategy and risk \nappetite. It also approves capital and \noperating plans for achieving strategic \nobjectives on the recommendation  \nof management. \nThe majority of the Board comprises \nindependent non-executive Directors. \nTheir role is to challenge and scrutinise \nthe performance of management and  \nto help develop proposals on strategy. \nThey also review the performance of \nmanagement in meeting agreed goals \nand objectives and monitor the Group’s \nrisk profile. During 2018, the Board \nreduced the number of Board committees \nfrom seven to five. These changes created \nclearer and stronger lines of authority and \naccountability, which enable the Board to \ndevote more time to priority areas.\nBoard diversity \nIn 2018, the Board’s diversity and inclusion \npolicy was updated to help ensure HSBC \nand its various stakeholders continue  \nto benefit from a Board that includes \nDirectors from a range of different \nbackgrounds and whose ethnicity, \nexperience, age, geographical provenance \nand gender more closely reflect the \ndiversity of our customers and the \ncommunities that we serve. The Board \ndiversity and inclusion policy is available at \nwww.hsbc.com/our-approach/corporate-\ngovernance/board-responsibilities. \n  For further details on our diversity and \ninclusion efforts, see page 24.Shareholder engagement \nWe welcome enquiries from individuals \non matters relating to their shareholdings \nand HSBC’s business. Communication \nwith shareholders is given a high priority \nby the Board, and there is regular \ndialogue with institutional investors. \nDirectors are also encouraged to develop \nan understanding of the views of major \nshareholders. As Senior Independent \nDirector, Jonathan Symonds is available \nto shareholders if they have concerns \nthat cannot be resolved or for which \nnormal channels would be inappropriate. \nHe may be contacted via the Group \nCompany Secretary at 8 Canada Square, \nLondon E14 5HQ.\nExtensive information about HSBC and \nits activities is provided to shareholders \nin the Annual Report and Accounts 2018 , \nthe Strategic Report  and the Interim \nReport  as well as at www.hsbc.com.\nCorporate governance regulatory \nchanges \nIn July 2018, the Financial Reporting \nCouncil published the new UK Corporate \nGovernance Code (‘Code’) together  \nwith the revised Guidance on Board \nEffectiveness. The new Code places \ngreater emphasis on how the Board \nconsiders the interests of all stakeholders \nin its discussions and decision making, \nand promotes a strong internal culture. \nWe see the new Code as an opportunity \nto further enhance our existing \nstakeholder engagement, ensuring that \nthe business as a whole can continue  \nto develop constructive and considerate \nrelationships. We aim to include details  \nof this in the Annual Report and \nAccounts 2019. \n Sustainability governance \nWhile the Board has oversight of the \nGroup’s sustainability and ESG initiatives, \nthe Group Management Board is \naccountable for their delivery, reflected in \nsustainability targets within the long-term \nincentive scorecards for executive \nDirectors, and selected scorecards of \nGroup Managing Directors. The 2017 \nlong-term incentive scorecards of \nexecutive Directors incentivise achieving  \na cumulative financing and investment \ntarget of $30bn to $34bn for developing \nclean energy and lower-carbon \ntechnologies and projects that contribute \nto the delivery of the Paris Agreement and \nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals \nover the three-year period to 31 December \n2020. The 2018 long-term incentive \nscorecards of executive Directors include \nan ESG rank measure incentivising \nachievement of ‘Outperformer’ \nSustainalytics rating.\nAs discussed in our TCFD disclosure on \npage 30, the Board receives a half-yearly \nsustainability update, covering topics such \nas progress against the three sustainability \npillars and non-governmental organisation \n(‘NGO’) engagement. This helps ensure \nour sustainability agenda remains \nprominent at the most senior levels. \nOur Climate Business Council coordinates \nsustainable finance activities across the \nGroup, supported by various working \ngroups within global businesses, \nfunctions and regions. An ESG Steering \nCommittee, chaired by the Group Chief of \nStaff, leads our approach on ESG topics, \nincluding considerations related to \nexternal disclosure and materiality. \nA climate risk working group was \nestablished in 2018, which seeks to \nimplement the objectives of the Climate \nBusiness Council through the development \nof policy and limit frameworks designed to \nprotect the Group from climate-related \nrisks (including transition risk and physical \nrisks) that are outside risk appetite. The \nGroup Risk Committee is responsible for \noverseeing enterprise risks that have an \nimpact on the Group, including climate risk.\nSee page 30 for our TCFD disclosure.\n40\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019A responsible business culture \nSafeguarding the  \nfinancial system  \nWe continued to consolidate our \nprogress in tackling financial crime  \nwhile launching initiatives in a number  \nof new areas.\nOur Global Standards programme, \nlaunched in 2013 to upgrade our financial \ncrime controls, is now approaching its \nconclusion. During 2018, we concentrated \non completing some of the final elements \nof the programme designed to ensure \nmanagement of financial crime risk is well \nembedded in our day-to-day activities, \nwith robust governance and reporting to \nenable performance to be assessed. \nIn June, we set out new strategic priorities \nincluding the aim of delivering industry-\nleading financial crime standards. \nDeveloping an intelligence-led approach  \nto financial crime risk management using \nnew technologies and advanced analytical \ntechniques is key to achieving this \nambitious target. We made good progress \non this agenda and will continue to develop \nour approach in 2019 and beyond.\nWe launched an anti-bribery and \ncorruption transformation programme, to \nenhance the policies and controls around \nidentifying and managing these risks \nacross the Group. We also launched a \ntransformation programme to strengthen \nour ability to fight fraud and protect  \nour customers. \n For more information on our Global Standards \nand anti-bribery and corruption programmes, \nsee pages 37 to 39.Technology \nTechnologies such as artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and advanced analytics will \nenable us to tackle financial crime more effectively. Our approach combines \ndeveloping our own technology solutions with bringing in the best external \ntechnology. \nOur investment in a start-up company called Quantexa enabled our investigators \nin 2018 to deploy a new software system to spot financial crime networks in near \nreal time by looking at internal and external data to find possible links between \nindividuals or companies. Working with another fintech company, Caspian,  \nwe have developed a system that assembles all the relevant information on a \nparticular suspicious transaction. It then uses AI to recommend whether it should \nbe investigated further, enabling our people to focus on the highest priority cases. \nOur flagship intelligence-led initiative is a new approach that combines a  \nrange of data sources to dynamically assess the potential financial crime risk \nthat an individual customer presents. We believe it will enable us to be faster \nand more accurate at detecting suspicious activity and more granular in our  \nrisk assessments. During 2018, we developed a prototype that, while at an  \nearly stage, has proved to be markedly better at finding potential financial  \ncrime than existing industry-standard methods. We will begin to implement  \nit in 2019, alongside existing systems. We continue to engage with regulators \non our approach.\nPartnerships\nThe insights delivered by new technology will have the greatest impact when \nwe work with partners. Public-private partnerships enable banks to share \ninformation with each other, regulators and law enforcement. We are a \nmember of all six public-private financial crime partnerships that have been \nestablished around the world. Through our membership we can provide \nbetter insight about suspicious transactions to law enforcement and receive \nintelligence that helps us to better target our work in detecting financial crime.\nWe continue to advocate for partnerships in other jurisdictions and for  \nthe effective operation of existing partnerships, including sponsoring public \nresearch into the future of financial intelligence sharing due to be released  \nin 2019.\nSociety \nDuring 2018, we successfully trialled an approach to providing victims of \nhuman trafficking in the UK with monitored retail banking facilities, working \nclosely with charities that provide support to victims. The aim is to help the \nvictims reintegrate with society and break the cycle of abuse. The accounts \nwere trialled through a small number of branches and we will now make them \navailable in other areas of the UK. \nFinancial crime can have a devastating impact on the societies that we serve, \nand we have taken active steps to reduce that impact. In October, we joined \nthe task force established by United for Wildlife to coordinate financial firms \ntackling the illegal wildlife trade by helping prevent the flow of illicit profits. \nMembers of the task force signed up to a declaration that commits them to \nsteps such as providing intelligence about the trade to regulatory bodies and \nlaw enforcement agencies. The scale of our work \nEach month, we screen over 658 \nmillion transactions across 207 \nmillion accounts for signs of money \nlaundering and financial crime. In \naddition, we screen approximately \n130 million customers and 37.3 \nmillion transactions monthly for \nsanctions exposures. During 2018, \nwe filed over 85,000 suspicious \nactivity reports to law enforcement \nand regulatory authorities where we \nidentified potential financial crime.\n41\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nTaxes paid – by type of tax\nTax on proﬁts$3,141m\nEmployer taxes$1,068m(2017: $2,896m)\n(2017: $1,178m)Withholding taxes$276m\nBank levy$1,135m(2017: $236m)\n(2017: $1,021m)\nIrrecoverable VAT$1,074m\n(2017: $1,102m)Other duties and levies$360m\n(2017: $364m)\nTaxes paid – by region\nHong Kong$1,398m\nRest of Asia-Paciﬁc$960m(2017: $1,043m)\n(2017: $938m)India$384m\nUK$2,693m(2017: $297m)\n(2017: $2,654m)\nSwitzerland$13m\n(2017: $(67)m)Rest of Europe$693m\n(2017: $753m)\nUS$162m\n(2017: $134m)Rest of North America$237m\n(2017: $182m)\nMiddle East and North Africa$233m\n(2017: $419m)Latin America$281m\n(2017: $443m)\nTaxes collected – by region\nHong Kong$162m\nRest of Asia-Paciﬁc$2,741m(2017: $297m)\n(2017: $2,415m)India$122m\nUK$1,398m(2017: $126m)\n(2017: $1,394m)\nSwitzerland$41m\n(2017: $47m)Rest of Europe$820m\n(2017: $752m)\nUS$835m\n(2017: $823m)Rest of North America$261m\n(2017: $263m)\nMiddle East and North Africa$118m\n(2017: $219m)Latin America$1,148m\n(2017: $1,768m)Keeping a responsible  \napproach to tax  \nWe seek to pay our fair share of tax in the \njurisdictions in which we operate and to \nminimise the likelihood of customers using \nour products to avoid or evade tax. Our \napproach to tax and governance processes \nis designed to achieve these goals. \nWe have established a formal tax risk \nmanagement framework, which is \ndesigned to ensure that tax-motivated \ntransactions or products are not adopted by \nthe Group. Significant investment has been \nmade to strengthen our tax risk processes \nand train staff to identify instances of \npotential tax evasion. There remain areas \nwhere further improvements are required \nand we are working to address these.\nWith respect to our own taxes, we  \nare guided by the following principles:\n –We are committed to applying both  \nthe letter and spirit of the law in all \njurisdictions in which we operate.  \nThis includes adherence to a variety  \nof measures arising from the OECD  \nBase Erosion and Profit Shifting  \n(‘BEPS’) initiative.  –We seek to have open and transparent \nrelationships with all tax authorities.  \nAs with any group of our size and \ncomplexity, a number of areas of \ndiffering interpretation or disputes with \ntax authorities exist at any point in time.  \nWe work with the local tax authorities  \nto try to agree and resolve these in a \ntimely manner.\n –We have reduced the number of legal \nentities located in very low or nil tax \njurisdictions from 121 at the beginning  \nof 2015 to 46 by the end of 2018. This \nprocess will continue throughout 2019 \nand 2020, with the aim of ensuring that \nthe HSBC entities remaining in such \njurisdictions are regulated entities \nessential for conducting business.\nWith respect to our customers’ taxes, we \nare guided by the following principles:\n –We have made considerable investment \nimplementing processes designed to \nincrease transparency and reduce the  \nrisk of banking services being used to \nfacilitate customer tax evasion and financial crime. These processes \nincorporate requirements arising from \nexternal tax transparency initiatives \nincluding the US Foreign Account Tax \nCompliance Act, the OECD Standard  \nfor Automatic Exchange of Financial \nAccount Information (the ‘Common \nReporting Standard’), and the UK \nlegislation on the corporate criminal \noffence of failing to prevent the  \nfacilitation of tax evasion.\n –We have processes in place to help \nensure that tax-motivated products are \nnot provided to our customers.\n For further details on our approach to  \nfinancial crime and what steps we have  \ntaken, see pages 37 to 39. \nOur tax contributions\nAs highlighted below, in addition to paying \n$7.0bn of our own tax liabilities during \n2018, we collected taxes of $7.6bn on \nbehalf of governments around the world.  \nA more detailed geographical breakdown \nof the taxes paid in 2018 is provided on \npage 65 of the HSBC Holdings plc  \nAnnual Report and Accounts 2018 .\n42\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019A responsible business culture\nRespecting  \nhuman rights \nBusiness does not exist in isolation: it  \nis part of communities and serves the \npeople. We recognise the duty of states \nto protect human rights and the role \nplayed by business in respecting them,  \nin line with the UN Guiding Principles’ \n(‘UNGPs’) Protect, Respect and Remedy \nframework. We have signed, or \nexpressed support for, a number of \ninternational codes, as set out in our \n2015 Statement on Human Rights.\nIn 2018, we set up a Human Rights \nSteering Committee, which is overseeing \nthe development of our approach to \nhuman rights. This approach will \nincorporate new recommendations from \ninitiatives such as the OECD’s general  \nDue Diligence Guidance for Responsible \nBusiness Conduct, published in May 2018. \nWe primarily reflect human rights \nconsiderations as they apply to our \npeople, our suppliers and our customers. \nSome examples are provided below.\nEmployees\nWe are committed to an inclusive  \nculture where our people can be \nconfident that their views matter, their \nworkplace is an environment free from \nbias, discrimination and harassment,  \nand where they can see that \nadvancement is based on merit. This \ncommitment reflects the provisions of \nboth the Universal Declaration of Human \nRights (‘the UDHR’) and the International \nLabour Organization Declaration on \nFundamental Principles and Rights at \nWork (‘the ILO Declaration’), including \nfreedom of association. For further \ndetails on the diversity of our workforce, \nsee page 24.Suppliers\nWe expect our suppliers to uphold \nhuman rights in carrying out their \nbusiness, reflecting the UDHR and ILO \nDeclaration principles. Our ethical and \nenvironmental code of conduct for \nsuppliers requires them to respect the \nhuman rights of their employees and the \ncommunities in which they operate, and \ncomply with all relevant legislation, \nregulations and directives. During 2018, \nwe undertook a risk-mapping exercise  \nto identify the most salient human rights \nrisks in our supply chain, particularly \nthose relating to modern slavery and \nhuman trafficking. \nCustomers\nThe principal aim of the UNGPs is to \nprevent human rights abuses. We seek  \nto ensure that the financial services we \nprovide to our customers do not result  \nin an unacceptable impact on people  \nor the environment. We are a signatory \nto the Equator Principles, which are \nunderpinned by the International Finance \nCorporation’s Performance Standards, \nand which focus on issues including land \nrights, child labour, forced labour, and  \nthe rights of indigenous and local \ncommunities. We work with our \ncustomers to help them improve their \nsustainability practices. Additionally, our \nfinancial crime teams actively seek to \nidentify the proceeds of potential human \nrights abuses to inform law enforcement \nand take ‘bad actors’ out of the financial \nsystem. A case study on this is contained \nin our Modern Slavery Act statement. \n \n Modern Slavery Act\nOur statement under the UK’s  \n2015 Modern Slavery and Human \nTrafficking Act gives details of our  \nwork in combating these particularly \negregious human rights abuses. We are \nraising awareness with our customers  \nin selected sectors and regions as part  \nof our annual credit review processes. \nWe are educating our own colleagues \ndirectly through training and indirectly \nthrough communications. \nStakeholder engagement\nWe remain committed to developing our \napproach to managing human rights risks \nas they affect rights holders. We attended \nthe UN Business and Human Rights \nForum in November 2018 and continued \nour involvement with the Thun Group, an \ninformal group of bank representatives \nthat provides guidance on how the \nUNGPs should be applied across banking \nactivities. We support the UN Global \nCompact’s promotion of sustainable  \nand socially responsible policies, and \nparticipate in the UK Chapter’s Modern \nSlavery Act working group. \nIn 2018, we had contact with five civil \nsociety groups where human rights \nabuses were raised. These abuses were \nalleged to have been committed by \nHSBC customers. We investigate \ncredible allegations of human rights \nviolations as they are reported to us  \nvia engagement with stakeholders. If \nrequired, particularly serious issues \nultimately pass to the Group \nManagement Board. \n \n43\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nWe believe that the global economy  \nis better served by customers being  \npart of the regulated financial system.  \nIn support of this, we carried out  \na number of initiatives in 2018 to  \nincrease access to financial services.  \nOur approach to financial inclusion  \nis focused on engaging with partners  \nto raise industry standards; improving \naccessibility of products and services; \nand investing in educational content. \nWe acknowledge that increasing \nfinancial inclusion is a continuing  \neffort, and there are a number of \ninitiatives we will be focusing on  \nin 2019. These include: \n –implementing the UK Finance Financial \nAbuse Code of Practice, which aims to \nincrease awareness for victims, potential \nvictims, families and colleagues to \nrecognise the signs of financial abuse \nand to offer support where needed; and \n –launching our Age Friendly Banking \ninitiative in Hong Kong to assist seniors \nto better understand key concepts  \nand services such as third-party carer \nbanking, digital banking and scam \nprevention. Supporting financial inclusion  \nWe work with trade associations, \ngovernments and regulators to identify \nbarriers to financial inclusion and find \nways to improve standards and share \nbest practice. For example, in 2018: \n –We chaired trade body UK Finance’s \nFinancial Inclusion and Capability \nworking group and were involved with its \nVulnerability sub-group; we were part of \na cross-Whitehall working group, which \nbrings together the government, banks \nand policymakers to develop strategies \non how UK banks can safely transfer \nWe believe that in order for people to \naccess and make the most of financial \nservices they need to understand how  \nto use them effectively to establish and \ngrow their wealth. To deliver this in 2018:\n –We delivered more than 1,000 financial \nwell-being seminars in the US, UK, \nMexico, Singapore and Australia, \nreaching more than 26,000 people \nincluding more than 2,100 HSBC funds to high risk and sanctioned \njurisdictions; and we provided \norganisational and staffing support, \nincluding the chairmanship, to the  \nUK Financial Inclusion Commission.\n –In Asia-Pacific we hosted an insurance \nindustry event as part of the annual Out \nLeadership summit, where we shared \nchanges made in our business to \nrecognise modern family relationships, \nand encouraged the industry to \nbecome more inclusive in their \nproducts and services. \nemployees, as part our RBWM’s  \nYour Financierge service.\n –We began refreshing the content we \nshare on our public websites, including \nintroducing guides to modern money \non our UK site. \n –We launched an online platform in the \nUS with EVERFI to help our customers \nand communities better understand \nday-to-day money management and \npreparing for the future. We believe that diversity helps us to fulfil \nour potential. We apply this philosophy to \nour products and channels to help ensure \nthey are inclusive and accessible for \nindividuals and SMEs. To deliver this in 2018:\n –We improved our digital accessibility in \n10 of our retail banking markets, so that \nmore customers can access online \nbanking. We also made physical services \nmore accessible by starting a ‘barrier-free \nbanking’ programme in Hong Kong to \nupgrade our branch and ATM networks. \n –We offered low- or no-fee banking \nservices in selected markets for \nindividuals who may not qualify for our \nproducts. These services are provided \nthrough basic accounts or waivers of \nminimum balance requirements. \n –We expanded the beneficiary definitions \nof our life insurance policies in Hong \nKong to recognise a broader range of family relationships such as stepchildren \nand same-sex couples. \n –We helped people experiencing cognitive \ndecline access and maintain banking \nservices through our Independence \nService initiative in the UK, and through \nour new Living with Dementia \nprogramme in Hong Kong. \n –We expanded the use of third-party \nalliances in Mexico so our customers \nnow have 10% more locations where \nthey can deposit cash and pay bills. \n –We announced a £12bn fund to lend to \nSMEs in the UK, and continued to be a \nshareholder in BGF Group plc (‘BGF’), \nformerly the Business Growth Fund. \nBGF provides patient equity capital to \nsupport SMEs across the UK and \nIreland. In 2018, the Canadian Business \nGrowth Fund, which we helped to \npromote and in which we are an \ninvestor, made its first investments.   Engagement with partners\nAccess to financial education contentAccess to products and services\n44\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019A responsible business culture\nAdditional  \ninformation\n45\nAdditional informationA responsible  \nbusiness cultureSupporting  \nsustainable growth Employees Customers Overview\nHSBC Holdings plc  Environmental, Social and Governance Update, April 2019\nThis ESG Update  may contain projections, \nestimates, forecasts, targets, opinions, \nprospects, results, returns and forward-\nlooking statements with respect to the \nfinancial condition, results of operations, \ncapital position, strategy and business of \nthe Group, which can be identified by the \nuse of forward-looking terminology such \nas ‘may’, ‘will’, ‘should’, ‘expect’, \n‘anticipate’, ‘project’, ‘estimate’, ‘seek’, \n‘intend’, ‘target’ or ‘believe’ or the \nnegatives thereof or other variations \nthereon or comparable terminology \n(together, ‘forward-looking statements’), \nincluding the strategic priorities and any \nfinancial, investment and capital targets \ndescribed herein.

But that principle gained \nnew traction in the latter half of 2019, when the Business \nRoundtable gave fresh voice to it. The new statement of corporate purpose said simply that companies should take the interests of all stakeholders — including sharehold -\ners, colleagues, clients, suppliers and communities — into account when making decisions. Who could have imagined just how urgent responsible companies’ commitment to serve the greater good would be, less than a year later? As I write this letter, we are in the midst \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, which will have \na wide-ranging and long-lasting impact \non every part of the world. Our global \nsociety and economy are being tested \nto an unprecedented degree. Managing \nthrough this crisis will require the best of \nwhat we, as a company and as a society, \nhave to offer. I know that the progress we \nhave made in the past has meaningfully contributed to our ability to weather the \npresent storm and, ultimately, to recover \nfrom it.\nWe know that this crisis is having a dispro -\nportionate impact on our most vulnerable \ncommunities. To help mitigate widespread \neconomic distress, our society needs \nto find better ways to address wealth \ninequality and provide more people with \naffordable access to financial products \nand services. Programs like Cobro Digital (CoDi), launched in Mexico last year, \nhave become increasingly relevant as a \n\nmeans of bridging the gap between the \ndigital haves and have-nots. Today, CoDi \nis enabling more than 5.5 million digital \nclients to send invoices and payments \nusing QR codes on their phones at no \ncost. Citibanamex is one of the leading \nbanks behind this innovative initiative \nand has had a leadership role since its \ninception.\nWe’re also continuing to support entre -\npreneurs through efforts like Scaling \nEnterprise, a $100 million loan guarantee \nfacility and joint effort with the U.S. \nInternational Development Finance \nCorporation (the former OPIC) and the \nFord Foundation. Scaling Enterprise \nprovides early-stage financing in local \ncurrency to companies that expand \naccess to products and services for low-income communities in emerging \nmarkets. To complement our lending \nactivities, our new $150 million Citi \nImpact Fund will make equity invest-\nments in socially oriented startups  \nand companies.\nAnd we continue to champion philan -\nthropic causes to increase economic \nopportunity. An urgent need is to help narrow the gap between the skills and \nknowledge many young people have and \nwhat they will need in order to succeed \nin this century. That’s why one of our \nlargest philanthropic focus areas is work -\nforce development. Last year, the Citi Foundation completed its three-year,  \n$100 million Pathways to Progress \ninitiative to invest in preparing youth for 21st century jobs, and we’ll soon expand \nthat program with an additional new \ncommitment. Last year, Citi and the Citi \nFoundation gave $147 million in grants \nand charitable contributions.I know that these efforts will continue and will even accelerate as will the time and \ndedication that my Citi colleagues pledge \nto supporting their communities. We have \ncommitted to build on the nearly 1 million \nhours of service contributed by Citi volun -\nteers in 2019, virtually and once we can safely re-engage with our communities.\nWe also strongly believe that our most \nimportant impact comes from our core \nbusiness activities, including the financ -\ning of critical infrastructure, affordable \nhousing, environmental finance and small \nbusiness lending. The economic recovery \nwill be further strengthened by institu -\ntions’ commitments to addressing an increasingly acute shortage of affordable \nhousing. Last year, Citi provided more \nthan $6 billion in loans for affordable \nhousing projects in the U.S., making our \nfirm the largest U.S. affordable housing lender for the 10\nth consecutive year. \nIt’s also my hope that one outcome of our present predicament will be an even \ndeeper respect for science and a recogni -\ntion of the investments in technology we \nwill need to make to help our world thrive \nin the years ahead. Innovation will be \nessential as we look to confront the many \nother challenges that critically impact us \nall — chief among them, climate change. \nOur health, our economic success and \nour environment are all inextricably \nlinked, which is why, despite the current \nchallenges, we must sustain our efforts \nto fight climate change. In 2019, Citi \nexceeded our $100 billion goal to help reduce the impacts of climate change \nthrough environmental finance activities \naround the world more than four years \nahead of schedule. Still, we know much remains to be done, quickly, and so we \nare as committed as ever to bringing our resources and capacity for innovation to \nbear as we seize the opportunity to even \nmore effectively and creatively tackle this \nurgent challenge.     \nBanks have a central role to play, both in \nhelping people and communities through \nthe current pandemic and in the ultimate \nrecovery. At Citi, we will continue working \nwith all of our clients and customers — \nindividuals, small businesses, companies \nand governments around the world — to manage the business and economic \nfallout of this pandemic. We will provide \nthe necessary support, credit and assis -\ntance programs that people, institutions and communities will need to rebuild.\nI write this letter with the utmost humility, \nas I know the work ahead will require \neven more focus, more dedication, more \npartnership and more commitment than at any time in recent memory. But we will use the lessons of the past and the depth \nof our partnerships to guide us. I have \nevery confidence that, as a company and a society, we will emerge stronger and more \ncommitted to the collective good than ever \nbefore. I know our citizens, our companies and our governments are resolved to do nothing less. My colleagues at Citi and I are \nmore than ready to help lead the way.\n  \nMichael L.

Our core activities are safeguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing the capital markets \non behalf of our clients. We have 200 years of experience helping our clients meet the \nworld’s toughest challenges and embrace its greatest opportunities. We are Citi, the global bank — an institution connecting millions of people across hundreds of countries and cities. \nWe protect people’s savings and help \nthem make the purchases — from every -\nday transactions to buying a home — that improve the quality of their lives. We \nadvise people on how to invest for future \nneeds, such as their children’s education \nand their own retirement, and help them \nbuy securities such as stocks and bonds. \nWe work with companies to optimize \ntheir daily operations, whether they need \nworking capital, to make payroll or to \nexport their goods overseas. By lending to companies large and small, we help them grow, creating jobs and real economic value at home and in communities around \nthe world. We provide financing and \nsupport to governments at all levels, so \nthey can build sustainable infrastructure, \nsuch as housing, transportation, schools \nand other vital public works. \nThese capabilities create an obligation to \nact responsibly, do everything possible to \ncreate the best outcomes, and prudently \nmanage risk. If we fall short, we will \ntake decisive action and learn from our experience. We strive to earn and maintain the public’s trust by constantly adhering to \nthe highest ethical standards. We ask our \ncolleagues to ensure that their decisions \npass three tests: they are in our clients’ \ninterests, create economic value, and are \nalways systemically responsible. When we \ndo these things well, we make a positive \nfinancial and social impact in the commu -\nnities we serve and show what a global \nbank can do. \nSustainable design is present throughout the renovation of our global headquarters in New York City, which will be completed in 2020. The building was recently \nawarded LEED Platinum certification.\n8\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nThrough our business, we address some of society’s greatest challenges — an imperative \nstated in our mission and an idea that shapes our decisions every day. In this report, we \nshare many individual stories of progress — how as a bank, employer and philanthropist, Citi catalyzes sustainable growth, helping to drive broader systemic improvements. We \nalso outline the ideas and frameworks, both internal and external, that guide us in this \nwork, ensuring that we tackle challenges and engage with our communities in a way that is consistent with our mission and values and in alignment with global and industry  \nefforts, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Principles for Responsible \nBanking and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nWhile our commitment to engagement, \ninnovation and market-based solutions \nis unwavering, we recognize that many \nof the biggest societal challenges are \npart of a significant economic and social \ntransition that will take years — in some \ncases generations — to come to fruition. \nWe continue to learn from our experience  \nand to bring diverse stakeholders to the table to help us understand what leader -\nship looks like on these evolving issues. \nThroughout the following pages, we \noutline how we put our guiding principles \ninto action. Our Guiding Principles\nWe are guided by a commitment to drive \npositive social and environmental impact \nthrough our products and services and \nour work with clients. Success — for us \nand for the financial services sector as a \nwhole — requires that we operate respon -\nsibly, building ethical decision-making into everything we do. When we do \nthis well, we have the latitude to drive \nsolutions through other avenues as well, using our corporate voice to engage in \ndialogue around the most pressing issues \nand reporting transparently about our own progress. We also use philanthropy and the time and talent of our employees \nto catalyze innovations for customers and \ncommunities in a way that can be brought \nto scale.\nExecuting a Business \nModel that Adds \nValue to Society\nThe scale and global reach of our \nbusiness means we are able to have \nsignificant impact through the products \nand services we bring to market. Our Our Approach to Creating \nPositive Impact\n9\nbusiness activities demand financial \ninnovations that meet the needs of our \nclients and tackle some of society’s \ngreatest challenges — a concept that is \nfundamental to our mission to enable \ngrowth and progress. Aligning with \nthis mission requires that we not only \npursue the opportunities presented \nbut also that we understand the risks \ninherent in our financing decisions and our own operations. This dichotomy \nis best evidenced in our efforts to \nfinance a sustainable economy  while \nunderstanding and mitigating our environmental and social risk . We know \nwe have a great deal more work to do in these and other efforts, as noted \nthroughout this report in discussions of \nthe management of our material ESG issues. \nMaintaining a Focus  \non Ethical Decision- \nMaking & Responsible  \nBusiness Practices\nEthical business practices are central to the success of the entire financial \nservices sector and are the foundation \nof all our activities at Citi. We place \nsignificant emphasis on understanding, \nimproving and fully integrating ethical \nand responsible practices into every -\nthing we do. \nThe Ethics and Culture section \nprovides more detail on how we do this — both our successes and where we \nsee need for continued attention and \nimprovement. \nTaking a Stand on \nIssues that Matter \nand Driving Solutions\nCompanies are increasingly expected \nto leverage their corporate voices to \nbenefit society. Like many of our corpo -\nrate peers, we have chosen to take a stand on a wide range of issues, includ -\ning climate change, pay equity, immi -\ngration, racial equity and gun violence \nin the U.S. We have made statements \nin response to issues that matter to \nour employees, clients, investors and communities. Speaking out, however, is \noften just the first step. Where we can, \nwe work to be part of the solutions to \nthese very complex and pressing issues. \nReporting  \nTransparently and \nLearning Through \nDialogue \nTo successfully meet the expectations \nof our stakeholders, especially as the \nscope and pace of disclosure evolves, \nwe need to both communicate what \nwe are doing and engage in dialogue \nto understand what more can be done. \nWe are committed to improving our \nreporting efforts and the way in which we engage stakeholders. For example, we have deepened our reporting on \nclimate-related risks and opportunities \nas part of our responses to the Task \nForce on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures, including more information \nin this report  as well as additional, \nstand-alone climate-related reporting .\nCatalyzing Innovation \nThrough Strategic  \nPhilanthropy \nand Employee Engagement \nCiti and the Citi Foundation support a \nvariety of philanthropic causes and, \nwherever possible, develop partnerships \nwith community organizations that \nallow us to catalyze change through \ninnovative and efficient solutions. In \n2019, the Citi Foundation  provided  \n$76 million in grants that increase  financial capability, promote job \nopportunities for youth and reimagine approaches to building economically \nvibrant communities. In addition, \nthrough Citi businesses around the \nworld, Citi provided $70 million in \ncharitable giving to causes that align \nwith our mission of enabling growth and \nprogress. \nWe increase our positive impact in \nthe community by encouraging our \ncolleagues to lend their time and \ntalent toward volunteer activities that complement our philanthropic giving. \nOur signature effort, Global Community \nDay, engaged more than 120,000 volun -\nteers in 2019, including Citi colleagues, alumni, clients, friends and families \nin more than 400 cities across 90 \ncountries. \nWe highlight examples of Citi and Citi \nFoundation philanthropy in the Inclusive \nand Resilient Communities section and \nprovide more detail on how we engage our employees in volunteer activities in \nthe Talent and Diversity section . !\n?\nRecognition of Our Efforts\nIn 2020, Citi placed seventh overall out of 300 firms — and first in the finan -\ncial category — in Newsweek ’s inaugural index of America’s Most Responsible \nCompanies, a ranking of the country’s top-performing companies in the context of corporate social responsibility. The rankings were based on an \nindependent survey of 6,500 U.S. citizens and an analysis of performance \nindicators included in external reporting.  \n10\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nCiti’s Support for \nClimate Action\nOver the last few years, numerous \nclimate reports, including those from \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC), as well as the Fourth \nNational Climate Assessment from the \nU.S. Global Change Research Program, \nmake clear that the world is rapidly \nwarming, leading to changes in weather \npatterns, sea levels and terrestrial and \nocean ecosystems. The impacts and costs of climate change are already affecting \nmany industries and regions globally and \nare expected to further increase as the \nworld continues to warm. \nThe science on climate is clear, and \nthe expectations of corporate and \ngovernment action are only increasing. \nFrom youth-led climate marches and \nschool strikes to investor proposals for climate-related disclosures, the pressure \nis mounting for companies like Citi to \ncontribute to solutions.\nTackling climate change requires a global \nenergy transition, as well as sustainable \nurban and regional development. As a \nglobal bank, we have a meaningful roleto play and are responding in several ways: through increased climate- \nrelated measurement and disclosure, \nenhanced Environmental and Social Risk \nManagement (ESRM) policies and reduc -\ntions in our own environmental footprint. We also are stress-testing our business \nand innovating our products  \nand services accordingly. \nWe demonstrate leadership by collabo -\nrating with other companies and orga -\nnizations to drive change. In 2019, for \nexample, we worked with other banks and \norganizations within the shipping indus -\ntry to develop and cosign the Poseidon Principles, a framework for lenders, \nlessors and financial guarantors to inte -\ngrate climate considerations into lending decisions with international shipping \nclients. Learn more in the ESRM section .\nWe also publish thought leadership content to stimulate dialogue and action. \nFor example, the Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS) report \nEnergy \nDarwinism III: The Electrifying Path to Net \nZero Carbon  offers data and narrative \nregarding the transition toward renew -\nable energy and away from fossil-based energy sources and technologies such as \ncoal and combustion engines. The report highlights some of the opportunities that \narise from this transition and the risks of \ncontinued investment in the incumbent \nenergy infrastructure.\n2° Investing Initiative \nScenario Analysis Pilot\nCiti is one of 17 international banks piloting the Paris Agreement \nCapital Transition Assessment \n(PACTA) methodology for climate \nscenario analysis of corporate \nlending portfolios, developed by \nthe 2\n° Investing Initiative . This \nmethodology allows banks to study the alignment of their corporate \nlending portfolios with different \n2\n°C and below benchmarks based \non the assets, technologies, and capital expenditure and produc -\ntion plans of companies in their portfolios. Reporting on Climate Change \nThe risks and opportunities connected to climate change affect many parts of our business. As such, there are \nmultiple points of reference — on our approach, results and challenges — throughout this report. For example:\nThe TCFD index highlights where climate-related content in response to the TCFD’s recommendations can be found in this report. Climate risk in transactions and \nclients — a critical topic as it relates \nto our core business — is considered \nthrough our ESRM Policy and \nbroader climate risk analysis, as \ndetailed in the ESRM section . Climate opportunities, and the \nrole Citi plays in financing a low-\ncarbon, climate-resilient future, \nare explored in more detail in the \nEnvironmental Finance section .Our operational impacts on \nthe climate, from our direct \noperations to our supply chain, \nare explored in the Operations \nand Supply Chain section .\n11\nCiti and the Task Force  \non Climate-related  \nFinancial Disclosures\nCiti has long recognized the global \nchallenge of climate change; we released \nour first Climate Change Position \nStatement in 2007. In 2017, our CEO \nsigned a statement of support for the \nrecommendations of the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures , \nwith the understanding that Citi needed to continue to build on its strong foun -\ndation of climate-related activity and \ndisclosure. Our objective is to understand \nthe potential financial risks to Citi, our \nclients and communities from climate \nchange, how Citi and our clients may be \ncontributing to climate change, and how \nwe can help our clients transition to a \nlow-carbon economy. \nWe conducted a TCFD gap analysis and \nidentified the climate scenario analy -\nsis recommendation as a key area of development for Citi and our sector. We \ncollaborated with the UN Environment \nProgramme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) —  \na global, UN–private sector collaboration with more than 240 finance institutions \nas members — and 15 other banks to design a banking-sector climate scenario \nanalysis pilot project. As part of this \npilot, we looked at transition risk under \n1.5°C and 2 °C scenarios for our North \nAmerican oil and gas exploration and \nproduction portfolio and our U.S. power \nportfolio, as well as physical risk under a \n4°C scenario for our U.S. power portfolio. \nIn late 2018, we published our first TCFD report, \nFinance for a Climate-Resilient \nFuture , in which we disclosed our TCFD \nimplementation across the four pillars of Governance, Strategy, Risk Management \nand Metrics and Targets, including the \nresults of our scenario analysis pilot \nproject. \nFollowing the release of that report, we \nconvened a half-day investor dialogue in \nFebruary 2019 with Ceres, a climate- \nfocused nonprofit organization, during \nwhich a group of institutional and ESG \ninvestors provided feedback on our TCFD \nimplementation and disclosures to date. \nWe learned that investors valued the \nlevel of transparency, effort and detail \nprovided in our reporting, appreciated the standalone report and were interested \nin seeing TCFD references in financial \nreporting and our Proxy Statement. We \nelicited these investors’ feedback on a \nnumber of potential actions Citi could \ntake on our TCFD journey, including:\n •Continuing to enhance our climate \nrisk governance\n •Supplementing our scenario anal -\nysis pilot work with a shorter-term \nclimate stress test, given the lack of \nalignment between the shorter time \nhorizon of loans and the longer time \nhorizon of climate change scenarios\n •Looking into third-party method -\nologies, including the 2 ° Investing \nInitiative’s PACTA tool and the \nPartnership for Carbon Accounting \nFinancials, to analyze the alignment \nof our portfolio with the Paris \nAgreement goal to limit warming to \nwell below 2 °C, and/or to measure \nthe carbon associated with our loan portfolio •Enhancing our approach to analyzing \nthe climate risk of our clients in \ncarbon-intensive sectors \n •Providing more metrics and setting \ntargets related to the carbon intensi -\nty of our credit portfolios\n •Conducting an assessment of physi -\ncal climate risk and risks to Citi’s own \nfacilities, as a complement to our \nbusiness continuity planning\n •Collaborating with others to nor -\nmalize climate disclosure, further \ndeveloping and standardizing climate \nscenario analysis and reporting, and \ndisclosing our learnings as we go\nWith feedback from our investors on how we might prioritize these numerous \npotential next steps, along with ongoing conversations with regulators and our \nlessons learned from our first phase of \nimplementation, in 2019 we embarked on \nphase two of our TCFD efforts.  \nOur 2020 TCFD implementation plan \nincludes activities across the following \nthree integrated pillars and builds in opportunities for investor feedback, peer \ncollaboration and quick learning so that \nwe can course correct as needed:\n1.  R isk Policies  — Integrating climate \nrisk further into Citi’s risk manage -\nment approach; reviewing and updating our ESRM Policy, including \nSector Standards, to ensure that \nour engagements with client sectors \nare guided by specific requirements \nfor higher-risk sectors, such as \ncoal mining and coal-fired power \ngeneration\n2.  Cl imate Scenario Analysis  — \nUtilizing climate scenario analysis to \nhelp understand differentiated client \nimpacts (or resilience) to stresses \nfrom physical or transition climate \nrisk\n 3.  C arbon Measurement  — Assessing \nand testing different emerging \nmethodologies to evaluate portfolio \ncarbon and portfolio decarboniza -\ntion pathwaysInternational Climate \nReporting Awards\nCiti was one of six global financial \ninstitutions awarded an International \nClimate Reporting Award for inno -\nvation and best practices. Citi was recognized for reporting related to \nclimate risk assessment and risk \nmanagement in our 2018 TCFD \nreport . The awards were jointly \norganized by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency and the French Ministry for Ecological \nand Inclusive Transition. \n12\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nIn addition to these three pillars of \nactivities, we are also actively partici -\npating in industry and multi-stakeholder workstreams to help build best practice in \nclimate risk assessment for banks; engag -\ning our clients on their own TCFD imple -\nmentation and low-carbon transition; and \nengaging with regulators on emerging \nclimate risk supervisory guidelines. We \nalso plan to increase training on climate risk internally to build awareness and \ncapacity.\nWe are still in a relatively early stage \nof extensive climate scenario analysis \nbut consider deepening our analysis of \nclimate-related risks and opportunities \nfundamental to our sustainability \ngoals and overall corporate strategy. \nTransparency and disclosure are critical \nto our efforts, and we continue to high -\nlight relevant climate disclosures in this \nreport. The TCFD Index indicates where \nrelated content can be found throughout \nthe report. We plan to publish an update \non our TCFD efforts in late 2020. \nCiti and the Principles for \nResponsible Banking\nIn 2019, Citi became the first major U.S. \nbank to endorse and become a signatory \nto the Principles for Responsible Banking , \njoining more than 100 banks around the world supporting this important effort. \nThe Principles were developed by the \nbanking industry itself, facilitated by \nUNEP FI.\nThese Principles, which define what it \nmeans to be a responsible bank, are \ndesigned to enable all banks to implement \nthem, no matter their specific context. The Principles also provide the frame -\nwork for a sustainable banking system, to guide the industry in demonstrating how \nit contributes to society, with an aim to \naccelerate its contribution to achieving \nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals \nand the Paris Agreement.Climate Scenario Analysis\nClimate scenario analysis is still nascent within the financial sector. We began piloting long-term climate scenario analysis in 2017–2018, building on \na number of different types of climate risk analyses that Citi had conducted \nover the previous few years. We undertook our first climate-related stress \ntest, a drought stress test, back in 2016, in collaboration with the Natural \nCapital Finance Alliance and UNEP FI. We followed this up in 2017 with a \nstranded asset analysis to understand the likelihood that upstream oil and \ngas assets in our energy portfolio would lose value because of a carbon price \nand how that would impact clients’ credit quality. More information about \nthese analyses is available in our 2017 Global Citizenship Report .\nWe continue to collaborate with our peers to refine the methodologies and tools developed during the UNEP FI pilot and to implement them more \nbroadly. For example, through Citibanamex’s participation in phase two of \nthe UNEP FI pilot project we are expanding our scenario analysis to cover additional sectors and geographies. In addition, we are continuing to partner \nwith climate scenario modelers from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact \nResearch and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis to \ndevelop disorderly transition scenarios suitable for financial analysis and plan \nto test these additional scenarios. We are also piloting and exploring other \nmethodologies and tools, such as the 2\n° Investing Initiative’s PACTA tool.\n13\nPhase 1 (2017–2018)\nRisk Policies\n •Updated our ESRM Policy with new restrictions on financing for the construction or \nexpansion of coal-fired power plants \nClimate Scenario Analysis\n •Co-developed methodologies with UNEP FI and 15 other banks, and conducted a pilot climate scenario analysis looking at transition risk (1.5 °C\n and 2 °C) associated with our \nNorth America oil & gas exploration and production and U.S. power portfolios, and physical risk (4 °C) associated with our U.S. power portfolio\nTCFD Disclosure \n •Published our first TCFD report, Finance for a Climate-Resilient FutureLearnings\n •A cross-functional team is required, including Environmental and Social Risk Management; Credit Risk; Quantitative Risk and Stress Testing; Sustainability & ESG; and Banking.\n •Sectors are heterogeneous, and some clients are more resilient than others to climate stresses due to factors such as cost structure.\nChallenges\n •Long-term orderly transition scenarios are not reflective of how climate risks are likely to evolve and are insufficient for understanding impacts on shorter- term credit portfolios.\n •There are continued data challenges and limitations with existing methodologies and tools available for climate risk assessment. \nPhase 2 (2019–2020)\nRisk Policies\n •Updating our ESRM sector standards for coal mining and coal-fired power and expand -\ning the climate risk section of our ESRM Policy\n •Established a global, cross-functional Climate Risk Working Group\n •Incorporated climate risk into our material risk inventory and risk taxonomy \nClimate Scenario Analysis\n •Stress testing the resilience of our global oil and gas exploration and production port -\nfolio to understand the impacts of a rapidly instituted carbon price (e.g., $50/ton of \ncarbon dioxide from 2019 to 2021)\n •Conducting a physical risk assessment of Citi’s own facilities to understand our exposure \nto various climate hazards and the resilience of our operations \nCarbon Measurement\n •Road testing the PACTA methodology to analyze the alignment of our credit portfolios with 2 °C scenarios \n •Assess the PCAF, the Science Based Targets initiative and other initiatives\nTCFD Disclosure\n •Convened an investor roundtable to obtain feedback and input on our TCFD strategy, implementation and disclosure\n •Publish our second TCFD report in late 2020, describing learnings from our current efforts Challenges Ahead\n •Data challenges remain, including incom -\nplete data for some client segments, which will need to be overcome.\n •Determining which methodologies are optimal is essential, as road testing different approaches is time and resource intensive. \n •Methodologies for assessing the carbon intensity and emissions of loan portfolios \nare still in “beta testing” mode and \nremain controversial.TCFD Implementation Highlights\n14\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nThese 17 interrelated Sustainable Development Goals represent an \nambitious agenda to achieve a sustainable future by 2030.

Throughout \nthis report, we have made an effort to \nindicate where information is relevant to \naction on the SDGs. While our work and \nthe content of this report cover many \nSDGs, we have identified seven goals on which we can have the greatest impact.In 2019, Citi joined with the UN and other business leaders to create the Global \nInvestors for Sustainable Development \n(GISD) Alliance, which promises to do more to address the multitrillion-dollar \nshortfall in funding for the UN’s goals. \nThe 30 members have committed to \nscale up our collective efforts to align our \nbusinesses with the goals and to remove \nbarriers to finance. The GISD Alliance \nwill operate on a two-year timeline, from \nOctober 2019 through October 2021, \nfocusing on solutions related to long-term SDG investment, particularly in developing \ncountries. Citi GPS, our premiere thought leadership \nproduct designed to help navigate the \neconomy’s most demanding challenges, \nuses the SDGs among other global refer -\nence points to inform strategic insight on topics such as single-use plastics and the \ntransition to more responsible production \nand consumption of plastics and other \npackaging materials. Citi GPS released a \nreport  in 2018 that aimed to simplify the \nSDGs and identify the incremental finan -\ncial costs and opportunities of achieving the individual goals and the human benefit \nthat might be gained by solving them. \n15\nESG Governance  \nat Citi\nGood governance is a fundamental prin -\nciple at Citi, and we work to ensure that \nwe are at the leading edge of best prac -\ntices. We strive to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct — reporting \nresults with accuracy and transparency \nand maintaining full compliance with the \nlaws, rules and regulations that govern \nCiti’s businesses. \nCorporate Governance\nOur governance structures, policies and \nprocesses serve employee, client and \ncommunity needs; promote a culture of \naccountability and ethical conduct across \nour firm; and support our commitment to address global challenges through our \ncore business. \nAll of our Board committees play \na role in providing oversight of our \nefforts to ensure responsible business \npractices. For example, the Personnel and Compensation Committee reviews \nall compensation programs, including \nincentive compensation, so that they \ndo not, among other things, encourage \nimprudent risk taking.

Our Global Sustainability \nSteering Committee provides guidance on environmental and social issues related \nto global business activities. The commit -\ntee is chaired by the CSO and a senior executive in our Institutional Clients \nGroup and includes executives from \nBanking, Risk, Public Affairs, Operations \nand Technology, and ESRM. Committee \nmeetings are held approximately three \ntimes annually. \nCiti’s ESRM Policy is managed by \nthe ESRM team, which works closely with ESRM specialists in the business \nand with regional ESRM Champions. \nWithin Operations and Technology, our \nCorporate Realty Services and Enterprise \nSupply Chain teams each have special -\nized sustainability groups that manage our environmental footprint and green \nbuilding goals and oversee supply chain \nsustainability. These specialized teams sit within their respective business units, \nensuring ownership of sustainability \ngoals throughout the company. For many years, climate risk has been addressed under our ESRM Policy in \nrelation to project-related finance, and \nCiti is actively working to develop more \ncomprehensive approaches to evaluate \nclimate risk across our business, includ -\ning reporting climate risk activities to the Risk Management Committee of the Board. To further our efforts, we \nformed a global, senior-level Climate \nRisk Working Group in March 2019. \nThis cross-functional group is tasked \nwith evaluating further integration of \nclimate risk considerations into Citi’s risk \nmanagement process, climate scenario \nanalysis and stress testing, climate data \nand engagement with regulators on climate risk management.\nCommunity Investing \nOur Head of Community Investing and Development leads the team that tackles \nchallenges within our communities \nthrough business investments as well as \nphilanthropy.

These ESG \ntopics, which we refer to as “material \nESG issues” throughout this report, help \ninform which issues we communicate \nhere, which issues we consider raising to our Board and how we establish our ESG \npriorities. Our most recent materiality assessment, which was completed in late 2017, \nincluded feedback through an online quantitative survey of more than 200 \nglobal external stakeholders and over \n500 Citi managing directors. It also \nincluded a review of the ESG attributes \nused by rating and ranking agencies and \na focus on how these issues will play out \nbetween now and 2030. \nWe complement our formal materiality \nassessment process with regular engage -\nment with stakeholders on how these issues are advancing. For example, we have engaged with investors on TCFD \nand with industry stakeholders on our \napproach to addressing climate change \n18Citi 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nand are able to use these insights to \nensure that we have a thoughtful and \ntimely approach to sustainability and \nclimate issues. \nA key insight underscored by our mate -\nriality process is the interconnectedness \namong material issues, such as acting in \nour clients’ best interests, systemic risk, \nclimate change and talent attraction and \ndevelopment. Our core business must \naddress these issues holistically, and our \nESG approach must enable the business to address the risks and opportunities \npresented by the material issues.\n \n  \n  Stakeholder \nEngagement at Citi\nOne of the most important ways we fulfill \nour mission to be a trusted partner to \nour clients is by engaging with a wide \narray of stakeholders to gain their input \nand insights and share our expertise and \nperspectives.

We rely on a variety of partner -\nships — with clients, governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), \nacademic institutions, and companies \nranging from startups to large, multi -\nnational corporations — to succeed. These partnerships highlight how our work contributes directly to SDG 17 , \nwhich seeks to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the \nglobal partnership for sustainable \ndevelopment . In particular, Citi’s efforts \ncontribute to target 17.3 , which seeks to \nmobilize additional financial resources \nfor developing countries from multiple \nsources , including the private sector, to \nensure sufficient financing is available to \nachieve the SDGs. \n SDG Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals Innovative Local \nGovernment and Community Change Agents\nIncreasingly, local governments and \ncommunity organizations are playing a \ncentral role as change agents, leading \non a wide array of issues, including \ninfrastructure, employment, housing \nand financial health. Moreover, these \nentities often do so while facing signif -\nicant budget and resource constraints. A core pillar of our efforts to invest \nin local communities is to collaborate with — and provide financial solutions \nto — local governments and community \norganizations. \nPublic-Sector and  \nInstitutional Financing\nWe provide a broad range of banking and \nfinancial products and services, advice \nand support to public-sector clients, such \nas government agencies, central banks, \ndevelopment organizations, NGOs and \nacademic institutions, to enable them to \nmore effectively provide critical services \nto local communities. \nCiti is uniquely positioned to support \nlarge, global organizations that are in \nneed of rapid solutions to solve complex \nproblems. For example, in Costa Rica in 2019, we supported the payment needs \nof the International Federation of Red \nCross and Red Crescent Societies. The \nRed Cross is responsible for operating a \nlarge fleet of emergency response ambu -\nlances, with fuel costs funded by Costa Rica’s Ministry of Finance. Historically, \nambulance drivers were given paper \nvouchers reflecting an approved monthly fuel allowance. The vouchers \nwere accepted at most (but not all) fuel \nstations and were occasionally lost or \ndamaged, rendering them invalid, leaving \nambulances without fuel and putting lives \nat risk. The Red Cross collected used vouchers monthly, reconciling and consol -\nidating the fuel expenses, which were then reported to the Ministry of Finance \nfor validation. This manual process was \nlabor-intensive and time-consuming.\nAt the request of the Red Cross, Citi \ndeveloped and implemented a tailored \npurchase card program to replace the \npaper voucher model. The now-automated \nsystem not only ensures that ambulance \ndrivers have access to fuel, it has also \nimproved efficiency and reduced costs for the Red Cross. \nMany institutional investors are looking \nfor returns beyond profit, and Citi offers \nproducts to meet this intent. Thematic \nbonds — such as social, green and \nsustainability bonds — provide a way for \ninvestors to see yields while also contrib -\nuting to positive environmental and social solutions. Thematic bonds continue to \nevolve to address changing needs and \nissues, and Citi works closely with clients and partners on new products. To learn \nmore about Citi’s efforts to promote \nthe growth of thematic bonds, including \ngreen and sustainability bonds, visit the \nEnvironmental Finance section . \nPhilanthropic Efforts \nAround the world, NGOs make valuable contributions to addressing difficult social \nproblems. But they need funding and \nother resources to amplify the impact of \ntheir work or to pursue as-yet-unproven \nsolutions that can be tested and later \nbrought to scale. This is often where \nCiti and the Citi Foundation can play an \neffective role. Moreover, by helping city \nleaders develop technology-driven solu -\ntions to urban challenges, our initiatives \nhelp support SDG 9 , which promotes \ninclusive and sustainable industrializa -\ntion and fosters innovation. \nSDG Goal 9:  Industry, Innovation and \nInfrastructure\n25\nCities for Citizenship\nIn 2014, Citi became the founding corpo -\nrate partner of Cities for Citizenship \n(C4C), a nonpartisan national initiative \naimed at promoting and expanding \nAmerican citizenship and financial capa -\nbility among lawful permanent residents in the U.S. What began with just three \ncities (New York City, Chicago and Los \nAngeles) has since grown to a network  \nof 92 American cities and counties.\nC4C celebrated its fifth anniversary in \nSeptember 2019 with 45 local citizen -\nship events across the country. Since the program’s launch, the network has \nreached nearly 1.8 million people who \nattended citizenship-related program -\nming, helped more than 48,000 people \ninitiate the citizenship process and/\nor apply for citizenship and connected \n30,000 individuals with financial \nempowerment services. C4C, which \nis also supported by the Center for \nPopular Democracy and the National \nPartnership for New Americans, plans \nto expand to 100 cities and counties in \n2020. In September, Citi was recognized by the United Nations Association, \nSouthern California Division, for our \nrole in catalyzing and scaling immigrant \nintegration efforts.Financing Sustainable Cities  \nInitiative\nThe Financing Sustainable Cities Initiative \n(FSCI), a partnership funded by the Citi \nFoundation, aims to help educate cities \nabout how to accelerate and scale up \ntheir investments in sustainable urban \nsolutions. In 2015, the Foundation \nteamed up with the WRI Ross Center for \nSustainable Cities and the C40 Cities \nClimate Leadership Group to help reduce \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions and improve quality of life for urban residents \naround the world. Areas of focus include \nbike sharing systems, low- and zero-emis -\nsion buses, rapid transit, transit-oriented development and affordable housing.\nThe FSCI consists of two primary \ncomponents:\n •Peer-to-peer learning communities through which cities can share their \nexperiences developing sustainable \nprojects\n •Direct technical assistance to cities developing sustainable finance strat -\negies and projects\nIn 2019, C40 Cities released a report  \nshowcasing early results of the initiative.     Economic Transformation Through Digital Technologies\nDigital technologies (especially relating to connectivity, big data and artificial intel-\nligence) are transforming every facet of the economy — globally and locally. With \npublic-sector expenditure in most countries accounting for anywhere from one-third \nto two-thirds of gross domestic product, it has become imperative for governments \nto drive digitization efforts. A strong digital economy requires a robust digital infra-\nstructure, with digital money, payments and identity all required for the transforma-\ntion of any industry or society. Citi’s Digital Money Index, published annually since \n2014, helps governments understand their respective countries’ readiness for usage \nof digital money. Each step taken toward digital money readiness can enhance a \nnation’s ability to transform its economy. According to the Digital Money Index, even a 10 percent increase in digital money readiness could help up to 220 million individ-\nuals enter the formal financial sector. A recent Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions \n(Citi GPS) report highlights the digitization of government, offering examples and \ncase studies of how countries are progressing on their digital journeys.\n8,900 \nsmall businesses expanded$7M \nin household energy costs saved  \nfor 32,000 low-income families\n33,800 \npeople trained for employment and 9,900  hired for new jobs\n$46 M \nsaved through tax preparation  service programs\n62,000 \npeopleCommunity Progress Makers Fund\nThe Community Progress Makers Fund \nsupports high-impact community \norganizations that are driving economic \nprogress in their communities.

The project ultimately resulted in new, user-informed communication materials about Prevention services currently being field tested.\n •Women in Rikers: Reentry: Studio designers were tasked with improving how women released from Rikers Island, home to many of the city’s inmate facil -\nities, access reentry services, so they return home in a strong and stable way. The redesigned referral management service and support infrastructure will be piloted in 2020.\nThe service design studio model is spread-\ning. The NYC Studio was influential in the \nformation of the Philadelphia Service \nDesign Studio announced in Fall 2019.  \n27\nInfrastructure\nAccording to the Global Infrastructure \nHub, the world faces a $15 trillion gap \nbetween the amount of money invested and the amount actually needed to \nprovide adequate infrastructure globally \nby 2040. In the U.S., the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers estimates there \nwill be a $1.5 trillion shortfall between the \namount of infrastructure needed and the \namount actually funded by 2025.\nPublic- and private-sector stakeholders \nneed to work together to find ways to \novercome investment barriers to much-\nneeded infrastructure projects. Citi \nfinances billions in infrastructure projects \naround the world. Between 2014 and \n2019, we provided more than $13 billion in green building and sustainable trans -\nportation projects. These activities, which were counted toward our $100 Billion \nEnvironmental Finance Goal , are helping \ncities meet the needs of rapid urbanization and work toward SDG 9 , which commits to \nbuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrializa -\ntion and foster innovation , as well as SDG \n11, which aims to make cities and human \nsettlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Our work contributes \nto target 9.1, which includes developing \nquality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure , and also supports target \n11.2, which includes an aim of providing \naccess to safe, affordable, accessible and \nsustainable transport systems for all. \nAs one example of our significant support \nfor infrastructure, in 2019, we served as \nglobal coordinator and joint bookrunner \nin a $400 million debut bond issuance to \nfinance the Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito, the sole airport serving Ecuador’s capital and the largest airport \nin the country. Execution of the bond \nissuance leveraged Citi’s unique combina -\ntion of insights and experiences with both global airport credits and Ecuadorian \nsovereign bond issuances. This trans -\naction was the first private sector bond issuance in over 20 years from Ecuador \nand demonstrates how financing of essential infrastructure assets can open \ndoors to new pools of international \ncapital for emerging markets.\nSDG Goal 9:  Industry, Innovation and \nInfrastructure \nSDG Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and \nCommunities \nCiti led the first private-sector bond issuance in over 20 years in Ecuador in support of the Mariscal Sucre International Airport in Quito.\n28\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \nAffordable Housing \nand Homeownership\nWhile homeownership in the U.S. has \nbeen rebounding, a lack of housing inven -\ntory continues to erode affordability, particularly for low- and moderate- \nincome households.\n1 Citi is working to \nhelp address the affordable housing crisis by financing projects in low-income \nurban areas and developing new models \nto strengthen affordable housing markets \noverall. This work aligns with SDG target \n11.1, which includes providing access for \nall to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services. \nSDG Goal 11:  Sustainable Cities and \nCommunities \nFinancing Affordable \nHousing\nWe offer a range of housing financing \nsolutions — including construction and \npermanent lending, tax credit equity, and \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage \nbanking — to affordable housing devel -\nopers. We focus on projects that serve low-income and special needs popula -\ntions, including seniors, individuals with disabilities and people who are homeless. \nOur work goes beyond just housing; we also finance projects critical to strong \nand vibrant communities such as schools, \nhealthcare facilities and businesses \nthat contribute to revitalization.

The property will include \naccess to a full range of supportive \nservices for adults and children. The \nentire building is reserved for residents with income from 30 to 60 percent of the \narea median income.\nOlder members of the LGBT+ community \nface high rates of discrimination, includ -\ning when seeking affordable housing. Citi \npartners with SAGE, one of the oldest \nnonprofit organizations dedicated to the \nneeds of the elder LGBT+ constituency in \nthe U.S., to help ensure that communities \nare equipped to support aging LGBT+ \nresidents through capacity building, \nconsumer education, advocacy, training \nand the construction of more LGBT+-\nwelcoming housing. In October 2019, with support from Citi, SAGE brought \ntogether housing developers, nonprofit \npractitioners and policy experts from \nacross the nation for an inaugural LGBT \nElder Housing Symposium in Washington, \nD.C. SAGE’s National LGBT Elder Housing \nInitiative aims to make the housing \nsector more welcoming of older LGBT+ \npeople. These efforts aim to contribute to meeting the need for affordable housing \namong the 3 million to 7 million LGBT+ \npeople age 50 and above expected over \nthe next decade.\nInnovative Approaches to \nCreating and Preserving \nAffordable Housing\nA half century after the Fair Housing Act \nwas passed to boost access to housing \nopportunities for all U.S. residents, the \nentry point for homeownership is only \ngetting more challenging to attain as \nhousing prices continue to rise.  \nCiti has identified and is investing in a \nproven tool for creating and preserving \naffordable housing: community land \nFemale veterans are the \nfastest-growing segment \nof the homeless veteran population in the U.S. In Dallas, 175 Citi employees \nvolunteered more than \n2,400 hours to help build a Green Extreme Home for female veterans — the first group home in the U.S. built under the U.S. Department of Energy’s Zero Energy \nReady guidelines. Citi also \nsupported the home project with funding as part of Bring Them HOMES. \nHousing for U.S.  \nVeterans\nOn any given night in America, an estimated  \n38,000 veterans are homeless.2 Many of them  \nstruggle with lingering trauma or suffer from  \nvarious physical or mental disabilities. Since 2012, \nCiti has supported LISC  and the National Equity \nFund’s Bring Them HOMES initiative, which finances, \nfacilitates, advocates for and implements affordable housing options for veterans. To date, a total of  \n5,000 affordable housing units, including 3,100  \nspecifically for veterans, have been completed  \nor are in development.\nFor example, thanks to support from Citi, \nSkid Row Housing Trust built an afford -\nable housing project in Los Angeles called The Six, which now provides housing and services to veterans. The housing complex’s name is derived from “Got your six,” a military phrase that roughly translates to “I’ve got your back.” In Sacramento, California, a complex with 39 units — most of them earmarked for veterans — opened in 2019, thanks to funding from Citi and money from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department  \nof Veterans Affairs.\nBring Them HOMES earned Citi a 2019 \nCommunity Commitment Award from the American Bankers Association — the first such award given for supporting military families. We were one of eight banks recognized for outstanding commitment to our communities.\n2     U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress \n(Part 1: Point-in-Time Estimates of Homelessness) .\n31\ntrusts (CLTs). A CLT is a nonprofit, \ncommunity-based organization, typically \nrun by a board, staff and community \nmembers, that buys land to build perma -\nnently affordable housing for low-income households. Dating back to the civil \nrights era, CLTs separate ownership of \nhousing from ownership of the land on \nwhich the housing sits. The CLT retains ownership of the land while enabling \nlow- and moderate-income households \nto purchase homes at affordable prices. \nThe homeowners agree to cap the resale \nprices of the residences to ensure that \nfuture owners benefit from affordable \nprices as well.\nToday, there are some 225 CLTs, compris -\ning more than 25,000 rental and 12,000 \nownership units, across the country. As \na leading supporter of CLTs in the U.S., \nCiti has invested approximately $7 million in seeding new CLTs in places like Miami, \nNew York City and Washington, D.C. On \nLong Island, which suffered significant \ndamage from Hurricane Sandy in 2012, \nthe Long Island Partnership Community \nLand Trust has committed to building \nover three dozen affordable homes — \nseveral of which have been completed \nand now house residents — thanks in part to a $1.2 million investment from \nCiti. In New York City, the mayor recently \ncommitted to CLT units for 3,000 \nfamilies, building on Citi’s $1.5 million \ninvestment in the Interboro Community \nLand Trust.\nIn San Francisco, it is nearly impossible \nfor affordable housing developers to \ncompete with private developers in one \nof the most expensive, cash-driven real \nestate marketplaces in the country. That’s why Citi worked with the City of \nSan Francisco to create the San Francisco \nHousing Accelerator Fund (SFHAF) — an \ninnovative nonprofit vehicle that enables \nmission-driven housing developers to \nmore nimbly and sustainably build and \npreserve affordable housing. Since its \nlaunch in 2017, SFHAF has funded the \npreservation and construction of 433 units, including a historic Mission Street \nbuilding that will provide eight apart -\nments for low- and moderate-income households. The acquisition is also \nhelping to preserve El Rio, a popular bar \nand cultural landmark that has served the \nlocal Latino and LGBT+ communities for \nmore than 40 years.In New York, Citi has invested $1.2 million \nin the Joint Ownership Entity NYC \n(JOE NYC), which is enabling neighbor -\nhood-based nonprofit housing organiza -\ntions to aggregate their affordable units \nto achieve economies of scale. Together, \nthese organizations are creating one of \nthe city’s largest nonprofit housing port -\nfolios. JOE NYC is on track to own 3,500 affordable apartments by 2020.\nBeyond homeownership, in cities such as \nSan Francisco and Washington, D.C., Citi has financed nonprofits that are trying to \nboost affordable rentals through acces -\nsory dwelling units (ADUs) — secondary dwellings on a housing parcel, such \nas basements, garage apartments or \nseparate freestanding structures. ADUs \nbenefit homeowners by creating income \nstreams while adding more affordable \nhousing in residential neighborhoods. In Washington, D.C., for example, the \nnonprofit United Planning Organization is \nteaching residents how to take advantage \nof zoning regulations that allow for the \nbuilding of ADUs. By educating qualified \nhomeowners on how to design, permit \nand build ADUs on their properties, \nhomeowners can increase property \nvalues, age in place, build intergenera -\ntional wealth and grow new skill sets in \ndevelopment and property management. \nThriving Small \nBusinesses\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, small businesses are at \nthe forefront of economic growth. Yet \nthey often face difficulties accessing \nthe capital and development resources \nneeded to thrive and grow. Through \ndirect financing and partnerships with \ncommunity organizations and local \ngovernments, we support the growth of \nsmall businesses and their contributions to the broader economic ecosystem in \ncountries around the world. In 2019, Citi \ninvested more than $10.6 billion in small \nbusiness lending in the U.S.New Tool Aims to \nAggregate Vacant \nLand for Affordable \nDevelopment\nAccording to federal statistics, \nnearly two-thirds of lower-income \nrenters in Miami spend at least half \nof their income on housing — more \nthan any other city in the nation. \nLocal officials and real estate devel -\nopers, however, have long said that there isn’t enough land available to \nbuild more affordable housing. \nA new online tool developed by the \nUniversity of Miami with support \nfrom Citi has revealed approximately \n500 million square feet — roughly \nthe size of Manhattan — of underuti -\nlized, publicly owned land in the greater Miami area that is potentially \nsuitable for affordable housing \ndevelopment. Called Land Access \nfor Neighborhood Development (LAND), the tool provides a real-\ntime snapshot of the location, size \nand ownership of thousands of \nparcels of publicly or institutionally \nowned vacant or underutilized land \nacross Miami-Dade County and its \n34 municipalities. In order to build, \ndevelopers would need to get access \nto land from the city and/or county or from institutions such as universi -\nties and NGOs.\n32\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \nThe fund, which is one of the largest stand -\nalone impact investing funds in the financial \nsector, will highlight the ability to achieve both healthy financial returns and positive social impact. It builds on and complements our other efforts to expand access to early-  \nstage financing by companies that are addressing community challenges.\nOne example of these other efforts is \nScaling Enterprise, a $100 million loan guarantee facility launched in 2019 by Citi, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (formerly OPIC) and the Ford Foundation. Through this facility, we are able to provide earlier-stage financing in local currency to companies that expand access to products and services for low- income communities in emerging markets. Loans and working capital in local currency and at affordable rates can enable inno -\nvative social impact companies to achieve scale, greater efficiencies and lower costs. Scaling Enterprise will facilitate vital growth financing to companies that are expanding access to finance, agriculture, energy, affordable housing, water and sanitation to low-income households in emerging markets. In the first two transactions under Scaling Enterprise, the partners have committed $5 million in financing to InI Farms to help smallholder banana and pomegranate farmers in India access export markets and increase incomes by up to  \n20 percent, as well as $5 million in financing to d.light to expand access to off-grid solar energy in Kenya.\nd.light, a social enterprise, received \n$5 million in financing to expand \naccess to off-grid solar energy in Kenya through Scaling Enterprise.\nCiti supports mission-driven enterprises that are working to build more equitable \ncommunities. In early 2020, we launched a $150 million venture capital fund that will allow us to make investments in U.S. companies that are addressing societal \nchallenges. The Citi Impact Fund will prioritize companies that are led or owned \nby women or minorities and that are using technology and innovation to help address four key societal challenges. Empowering Mission-  \nDriven Enterprises\nCiti’s Impact Fund focuses on four key areas:\nPhysical & Social  \nInfrastructure\nSolutions that improve an  \nindividual’s way of life \nthrough housing, healthcare \nand transportationWorkforce  \nDevelopment\nSolutions that train  \nand connect people \nto careersSustainability\nSolutions that address \nissues related to energy, \n water and sustainable  \nproductionFinancial  \nCapability\nSolutions that \nincrease access to the \nfinancial system\n33\nSupporting Women- and \nMinority-Owned Small \nBusinesses\nThe gender and race gaps in the world \nof small businesses are very real, with \nreports showing that less than 3 percent \nof venture capital funding is allocated to \nwomen- and minority-owned startups. \nIn New York City, for example, there are \nalmost 360,000 female entrepreneurs \nwho contribute approximately $50 billion \nannually in revenue to the city’s economy. \nYet research by Citi found that men own 1.5 times the number of businesses, \nhave 3.5 times the number of employees \nand generate 4.5 times the amount of \nrevenue.\nCiti aims to change the statistics for \nwomen- and minority-owned businesses by investing in programs that emphasize \nentrepreneurship, employee ownership and local contracting. We support these \nefforts through a number of partnerships, \nincluding the following:\n •Women Entrepreneurs NYC (WE NYC) was launched by the NYC Department \nof Small Business Services in 2015 \nto connect aspiring and established \nfemale entrepreneurs to the re -\nsources, education and community services needed to build thriving \nbusinesses. Citi supported the initial \nresearch study that defined the \nprogram design as well as WE Master Money: Credit, connecting women \nwith credit-building workshops and \none-on-one counseling to help them \nmanage credit and access more \nloans, thereby building credit and \nfinancial resilience. Since its launch, WE NYC has surpassed its initial goal \nof serving 5,000 women by helping \nmore than 6,000 female entrepre -\nneurs develop their ideas and expand their enterprises.\n •The National Coalition for Asian \nPacific American Community \nDevelopment issued a report sup -\nported by Citi called Small Business, \nBig Dreams , which highlights \nhow entrepreneurship is a critical asset-building pathway for many \nmembers of the Asian American and \nPacific Islander (AAPI) community. \nAAPI immigrants start businesses at \na higher rate than the general U.S. \npopulation, yet they face significant \nobstacles to business growth, includ -\ning language barriers and limited \naccess to capital. \nShinar Little (far right), owner of FogHill, Inc., stands with some of his employees outside of Georgetown University. Little benefited from the DC Community \nAnchor Partnership, a program that connects local, minority-owned firms with leading university and health system organizations in the nation’s capital. Citi \nprovided seed funding for the program.\n34\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \n •The Democracy at Work Institute  \nand the National League of Cities are \npart of a national movement aimed  \nat encouraging business owners of \ncolor to convert their businesses \nto employee ownership models to \npreserve wealth and stabilize commu -\nnities. In the U.S., more than  1 million business owners of color are \nnearing retirement. Collectively, they employ more than 8.2 million people \nand generate more than $1.2 trillion \nin annual revenue. Yet fewer than \n20 percent of these business owners \nhave post-retirement succession \nplans. In Washington, D.C., where \nnearly 40 percent of Black business \nowners are nearing retirement age, \nCiti supports the D.C. Employee Ownership Initiative to preserve \nlegacy businesses and create new \npathways to entrepreneurship. We \nalso support Project Equity, a non -\nprofit that helps retiring business owners transfer company ownership \nto employees to preserve small \nbusinesses in Southern California  \nand South Florida.\n •In Los Angeles, Citi was the founding corporate sponsor of a regional \ncollaborative launched to make it \neasier for small businesses to bid for \nlocal contracts worth more than  \n$1 billion. Small business owners have \nfor years battled with a fragmented, \nantiquated and complex contract pro -\ncurement system in the Los Angeles area. The newly launched OneLA Regional Collaborative establishes \na partnership between some of the \nlargest public agencies in the region \nseeking to connect diverse business -\nes to technical assistance, business resources and public and private \ncontracting opportunities. The new \nsystem will streamline and speed up \nthe procurement process and give small businesses a fairer shot as they \ncompete for contracts. \nLearn how we are supporting women-  and minority-owned small businesses in \nour own supply chain in the Operations and Supply Chain section .Microfinance as a Path to Women’s Economic \nEmpowerment  \nCiti has partnered with the U.S. International Development Finance \nCorporation (DFC, formerly known as OPIC) to expand microfinance loans \nto women in emerging markets around the world. In 2019, we committed \nto work with the DFC, the U.S. Agency for International Development and \nprivate-sector partners to mobilize an additional $500 million for women in \nLatin America. In Tunisia, we recently announced the launch of a $10 million \nloan guarantee facility, which will provide growth financing to more than \n17,000 microentrepreneurs, approximately 65 percent of them women. And \nin Jordan, Citi provided $5 million to Microfund for Women, which will now be \nable to give loans to an additional 10,000 underserved Jordanian women.\nCiti also has partnered with CreditAccess Grameen, which was born out of \nthe need to provide timely and affordable credit to low-income households in \nIndia. Women in India make up 60 percent of the country’s unbanked popula -\ntion of 190 million people. In 2019, Citi provided $29.5 million to CreditAccess \nGrameen to help reach an additional 75,000 women with an average loan size \nof $390.\nMicrofinance loan programs are typically associated with emerging markets, \nwhile the need for such programs in industrialized countries such as the U.S. is often underappreciated. A decade ago, Citi collaborated with Grameen \nAmerica to help establish the organization’s first office in Queens, New York. \nGrameen America members — who are all minority and immigrant women \nliving on lower wages — are provided with microloans, fee-waived Citi savings \naccounts, peer support and financial education to help them expand their \nbusinesses and generate income for themselves and their families. Grameen \nAmerica released early results  of the most rigorous, independent, third-party \nevaluation of group microfinance in the U.S. to date, which was produced with funding from Citi. This important preliminary research on Grameen America’s lending program demonstrates that helping women build positive credit histo -\nries and raise credit scores is a powerful approach to expanding economic opportunity for fledgling entrepreneurs. Since launching in 2008, more than \n129,000 women have received over $1.4 billion in microloans through this \nprogram to start and grow their businesses — with 99 percent repayment.  \nMost microfinance beneficiaries globally are women, making Citi’s work on \nmicrofinance a direct contributor to SDG 5 , in support of gender equality and \nempowerment for all women and girls , and in particular target 5.a , which \nstrives for a range of gender-related objectives, including giving women \nequal rights to economic resources .\nSDG Goal 5:  Gender Equality\n35\nPreserving Local Jobs \nCiti works with public and private part -\nners to help remove the individual and \nsystemic barriers to success for current \nand aspiring small business owners, such \nas access to capital and affordable space, \nas well as roadblocks to entrepreneur -\nship. Because the specific challenges facing entrepreneurs often vary by city \nand region, we engage with local entities \nto implement thoughtful solutions. \nIn New York City, Citi partners with LISC \nNYC and the NYC Department of Small Business Services to help revitalize \ncommercial corridors and small busi -\nnesses across the city. Community orga -\nnizations apply for funding and access \nto expertise to implement initiatives that \nare most valuable to their corridors. \nThe organizations focus on storefront \nimprovements, such as new signage and \nlighting, as well as broader efforts aimed at boosting foot traffic, increasing sales \nand contributing to a greater sense of \nsafety. \nUrban manufacturing also holds great \npromise as a path to higher-wage employ -\nment and greater economic security. New York City has made development of the \nindustrial and manufacturing sector a key \ncomponent of its strategy to create more \nliving-wage employment. Together, Citi \nand the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development launched the \nUrban Manufacturing Accelerator Fund \nto create and preserve quality manufac -\nturing jobs in New York City. The Fund provides frontline resources that enable \nnonprofit developers to more effectively \nacquire and renovate manufacturing \nspace by leveraging financing from the \nNYC Economic Development Corporation.\nIn Brooklyn, a $6.85 million warehouse \nrenovation project will create 10,000 square feet of industrial space to be \nleased at affordable rates for local \nindustrial businesses and manufacturers. \nThe project is one example of progress in \nthe City of New York’s 10-point Industrial \nAction Plan, which is aimed at growing 21\nst century industrial and manufacturing \njobs in New York City. In the Bronx, a mixed-use, 50,000-square-foot industrial \nspace that will create industrial and \ncommercial space, as well as 740 housing \nunits and open workspaces, will open \nin three phases by 2024. The Urban \nManufacturing Accelerator Fund helped \nto catalyze both projects.\nFinancial Inclusion\nMost people can easily comprehend the \neconomic and social case for ensuring \nthat all households have access to the \nfinancial products and services they \nneed. But to develop solutions that meet \nthe needs of underserved households, we \nneed to understand the financial behav -\niors of customers who are at risk of being excluded. Without that, even the most \ninnovative and thoughtfully developed \nproducts will fail.\nCiti works to develop solutions that are \nsafe, transparent and accessible — ones \nthat provide real economic value, includ -\ning for those whose financial needs are currently unmet. We seek out innovative \npartnerships with financial institutions, \ntelecommunications and fintech provid -\ners, government agencies, consumer \ngoods companies and others that have \nclose relationships with the unbanked and \nthe underserved segments of society. \nOur partners are trusted leaders in their \nsectors who understand the needs of \ntheir local markets. \nSuccess also requires setting public \npolicy priorities and building the industry. \nFinancial Inclusion and the SDGs\nAn estimated 1.7 billion adults around the world, in both developing and developed \nmarkets, remain outside the formal banking sector. To improve access for these people, \nbanks need to understand and address the mistrust of financial institutions among many \ntraditionally underbanked communities and also invest in innovative products that meet \ntheir unique needs. We offer a variety of products, tools and services that help improve \nfinancial resiliency and inclusion in these communities and partner with organizations \nthat are increasing access to financial services and providing educational resources to \nresidents.\nOur extensive work on financial inclusion contributes to progress on SDG 8, which aims, \namong other things, to provide full and productive employment and decent work for \nall. For example, Citi’s work on financial inclusion around the world contributes to target \n8.10, which aims to strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to  encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all. \nInclusive finance is also a key success factor for progress on SDG 9, which aims to build \nresilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and  \nfoster innovation, specifically enabling progress on target 9.3 , which seeks to increase \nthe access of small-scale enterprises, particularly in developing countries, to  financial services to facilitate integration into value chains and markets. \nSDG Goal 8:  Decent Work and Economic Growth \nSDG Goal 9:  Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure \n36\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \nFor example, the Citi Foundation has \nsupported the Better Than Cash Alliance \nat the United Nations; the Alliance works \nwith governments and businesses around \nthe world to introduce public policy, regu -\nlations and best practices that accelerate digital platforms and financial access. But \nto empower significantly more people and \nbusinesses, we need even more collective \naction. No single company, industry or government agency can tackle these \nissues alone. \nMaking Financial  \nProducts and Services \nMore Inclusive\nCiti is working to expand access to safe \nand affordable products and services \nwithin low-income communities and \ncommunities of color, where a lack of \naccess to financial products and services \ncan leave families financially vulnerable. \nWe harness our global infrastructure \nand the deep expertise of our colleagues \nand collaborate with other institutions to \nunderstand the challenges of our clients and create scalable, responsible and \ncommercially viable solutions that expand \naccess and deliver greater inclusive \neconomic growth.  \nIn Mexico, where 63 percent of adults are \nunbanked and 80 percent of payments \nare made in cash, we’re focused on \nbringing more residents into the formal \nbanking system. Through the launch of \nthe Cobro Digital market-wide initiative \n(or CoDi Payment, for short), Mexico is \nenabling more than 5.5 million digital \nclients to send collection requests and \npayments of up to 8,000 pesos ($400 \nUSD) by using QR codes and near-field communication (NFC) on their phones \nat no cost. Citibanamex is one of the \nleading banks in the initiative and has \nhad a leadership role since inception. \nCoDi will redefine the way charges and \npayments are made in Mexico, allowing \nmonetary transactions to be made more \nefficiently and securely. The new platform works with all smartphones, banks and telephone carriers. \nIn the U.S., we have established relation -\nships with 28 minority-owned depository \ninstitutions, community banks and credit unions as part of our Citi ATM Community \nNetwork, a pilot program we started in \nJuly 2016. Today, more than 440,000 \ncustomers of these institutions are able \nto use any of Citibank’s 2,300 ATMs \nwithout paying out-of-network fees. By \nremoving surcharge fees on cash with -\ndrawals from Citibank branch ATMs, we are helping to reduce transaction costs, \nimprove convenience and choice for \ncustomers, and expand access for people in the communities we serve. \nFostering Financial  \nEducation and \nEmpowerment\nBuilding financial knowledge and skills \nand encouraging positive financial behav -\niors are important components of a more inclusive financial system. Consumers \n37\nneed access to financial products and \nservices, as well as the ability to use these \nproducts responsibly while protecting \ntheir own best interests. \nCiti offers a range of free, publicly \navailable financial education resources \nonline, including tools that help consum -\ners plan for retirement, prepare for life changes and protect their wealth. In some \ninstances, when customers may need \nspecial assistance, we provide support to \naddress their needs. For example, during the U.S. federal government shutdown \nthat ended in early 2019, Citi offered a \nrange of assistance measures for custom -\ners experiencing financial hardship as a result of the shutdown, including fee and \ninterest adjustments, minimum payment deferrals and forbearance programs. Late \nin 2019, we provided a suite of disaster \nrelief packages to customers impacted by \nAustralia’s bushfires, including a payment \nmoratorium with a suspension of repay -\nment and no interest or fee charges. \nWe also partner with community orga -\nnizations to build financial capability \nfor individuals and communities. In the \nU.S. in 2019, Citi collaborated with more \nthan 20 municipalities and counties, as \nwell as leading nonprofit organizations, to support free tax preparation services \nand address the billions of dollars in \nunclaimed Earned Income Tax Credits \n(EITCs) left on the table by millions of \nlower-income working households annu -\nally. The EITC, a refundable tax credit for lower-income workers, is often the largest lump-sum payment these households \nreceive all year. Yet according to the \nInternal Revenue Service, one out of \nevery five eligible households does not \nclaim the EITC and, of those who do file, \nmany pay hundreds of dollars to file their \ntaxes when there are free, professional \nfiling services available to them. \nCiti provided approximately $4.5 million \ntoward 2018 and 2019 tax time initiatives. \nIn 2019, Citi’s investments had widespread positive impact, especially across the \nstate of California, where Citi-supported \ntax preparation campaigns and services \nhelped 29,500 eligible filers complete \ntheir EITC forms, which yielded over \n$58.5 million in tax credits claimed. These \nfree tax preparation services helped filers \nsave an estimated $6.8 million in tax \npreparation fees.\nAlso in 2019, Citi announced the expansion \nof Empowered Cities, a landmark initiative designed to advance financial inclusion \nand economic opportunity for people \nwith disabilities, many of whom live on \nlower incomes. Citi’s $2 million commit -\nment will expand the initiative to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, \nbuilding on the existing partnership with \nthe City of New York and the National \nDisability Institute. Empowered Cities is also expanding the initiative’s areas of \nfocus to include housing and employment \nfor financially vulnerable households in \nthe disability community. Individuals with \ndisabilities and their families are among \nthe most underserved and financially \nvulnerable groups in the country. There \nare 61 million people with a disability \nin the U.S., and more than a quarter of them are living below the poverty line. \nThe national expansion builds on the first \nmunicipal model, EmpoweredNYC, which \nlaunched in early 2018 with an initial       \n$2 million seed investment from Citi. Led \nby the NYC Department of Consumer and \nWorker Protection’s Office of Financial \nEmpowerment, EmpoweredNYC has deliv -\nered more than 1,100 specialized financial \ncounseling sessions to nearly 700 New \nEmpoweredNYC launched  \nin early 2018 with an initial \n$2M \nseed investment from Citi\nEmpoweredNYC has  \ndelivered more than \n1,100 \nspecialized financial counseling  \nsessions to nearly 700 New Yorkers\n38\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \nYorkers with disabilities and their families. \nIn 2019, we participated in a convening of \ncommissioners from 10 mayoral offices \nand disabilities-focused leaders to explore \nhow we can address the most pressing \nfinancial security issues facing the disabil -\nity community.\nIn addition, we work with several \nmunicipal and community partners to \nprovide immigrants with knowledge and \nresources to strengthen their financial \ncapabilities. Many Mexican immigrants \nin the U.S., for example, are not familiar \nwith the country’s complex financial \nand tax environment and face real or \nperceived obstacles rooted in language, \nculture and barriers to trust. The Ventanilla de Asesoría Financiera (VAF) \nprogram operates on-site at Mexican \nconsulates and offers in-language guid -\nance on opening a bank account, budget -\ning, paying off debt, gaining access to \nfree tax preparation, establishing credit \nand building a secure financial future. Citi \nprovided seed funding to create and scale \nthis model and has collaborated with the Foreign Ministry of Mexico to expand it \nto 48 consulates across the country. Of \nthe 48 VAFs operating in the consular \noffices of Mexico in the U.S., Citi directly \nfinances eight. In 2019, the VAF program \nwas featured at the first-ever summit for \nfinancial inclusion of Mexicans abroad, \nwhich was attended by key Mexican \ngovernment officials across finance, education and foreign affairs. \nEmpowered Through \nEducation\nEducation is one of the best means for \nimproving one’s financial situation. But \nhigh costs and other socioeconomic \nbarriers can put higher education out of \nreach for many, especially those who are \nunbanked or living on lower incomes. \nIn the U.S., where the rising cost of a \ncollege degree can prevent many from  \npursuing higher education and leave \nmany others saddled with significant \ndebt, Citi Start SavingSM aims to help. \nThe program launched in San Francisco, where one in three children are born into families with little to no savings. For \nmany of these children, a college savings account could be their family’s first expo -\nsure to mainstream financial services as well as a pathway to opportunity. \nIn 2009, when then-Mayor Gavin \nNewsom put forward his vision for a \nuniversal children’s savings program, Citi \nstepped up to the challenge. We worked \nwith the city, teachers and parents to \nunderstand the needs and challenges \nof establishing a savings program in \nwhich every child, even those whose parents may be unbanked and those who are foster children, is included. \nThe result was Kindergarten to College \n(K2C), the nation’s first universal youth savings account program, built on the \nfirst-of-its-kind Citi Start Saving platform. \nA K2C account contains an initial $50 \nincentive for every child who enters the \ncity’s public school system. Additional \nincentives are awarded over time for \nmaking deposits or for positive behaviors \nin school.\nA new update to Citi Start Saving that \nwas deployed in 2019 provides five \ndifferent automated channels for taking deposits and automatically processes \nBrave Girl Rising  is a short film presented by the nonprofit behind the global campaign for girls’ \neducation and empowerment Girl Rising. The film follows a young refugee woman named Nasro \nwho sees education as her lifeline, yet who every day faces formidable challenges in accessing this fundamental human right. In telling her story, the film seeks to illuminate the plight facing millions of \nrefugee girls around the world and inspire action for girls’ education and empowerment. Citi, which \nsupported the film with the International Rescue Committee and others, hosted over 160 screenings of the film when it premiered on March 8, 2019, on International Women’s Day.\n39\nand reconciles transactions and posts \ndaily. These updates help families have \ngreater control over their financial \nresources and immediately see how daily \nactivity impacts their overall position. \nParticipants and their families can \naccess information on their program \nand accounts 24/7 from a desktop, \nsmartphone or tablet. In September, \nCiti Start Saving enabled about 11,000 San Francisco public school students, \nincluding 5,000 kindergarteners, to kick \noff the new school year with this powerful \nnew tool for achieving future success and \nsaving for their education.\nWe have made this platform available \nto any municipality that wants to start \na child savings account (CSA) program. \nResearch has shown that even a small \namount of college savings can help build \naspirations and encourage young people to view a college education as attainable. \nWe recognize, however, that creating \naspiration is not enough. We know that \nsteps need to be taken to address the \nsystemic roadblocks to higher educa -\ntion, especially for low-income families. Universal access to youth savings \naccounts is but one tool that can help \nadvance that goal.The Future of Work\nThe youth unemployment rate is three times higher than that of adults. \nAllowing economically disadvantaged \nyoung people to turn into economically \ndisadvantaged adults contributes to a \ndestructive cycle that hinders the growth \nof communities, cities and economies. Citi \nand the private sector as a whole have a \nrole to play in helping to make the next \ngeneration the most employable yet. And public–private partnerships are among \nthe most effective ways to reach low- \nincome communities at scale and drive \npositive social and economic gains. \nThrough the Pathways to Progress initia -\ntive, Citi and the Citi Foundation help to \ndeliver on SDG target 8.6 , which aims \nto substantially reduce, by 2020, the \nproportion of youth not in employment, \neducation or training. \nSDG Goal 8:  Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth \nPathways to Progress\nThe Citi Foundation’s Pathways to \nProgress initiative is designed to help \nclose the job-skills mismatch by providing \nyoung people with the tools they need \nthrough training, work experience and \nentrepreneurial opportunities. \nSince 2014, the Citi Foundation has \ninvested more than $194 million to impact the lives of youth globally. As we look ahead, we remain committed to tackling \nthe youth unemployment challenge. \nThe Citi Foundation will reaffirm its \nphilanthropic commitment, and we will \ncomplement these investments with \nyouth-focused efforts happening across \nCiti, including programs that are helping \nus build a more diverse talent pipeline \nwhile also preparing the next generation for today’s workforce. \nIt is important for us to share the valu -\nable lessons that have informed the \nFoundation’s programming and shaped \nthe evolution of this commitment. We \nbelieved then and continue to believe now \nthat empowering young people, providing \nearly work experience and financial \nknowledge, incubating an entrepreneurial \nmindset, creating networks and access \nto role models, and driving systemic and structural changes to the field of \nwork are each integral to helping the \nnext generation build stronger futures \nfor themselves, their families and their \ncommunities. We recently published a \nreport, entitled \nPathways to Progress: \nInsights from Six Years of Programming  \nthat reflects on these learnings. Learn more about Pathways to Progress on the \nnext page.  \nWhat’s Ahead\nWe will continue to collaborate both internally across our business units and \nwith external stakeholders to maximize \nour impact and ensure an intersectional \napproach to the interrelated challenges \nfacing our communities, such as wealth \ninequality and race, access to capital  \nand gender, and financial capability and \ncitizenship status. We will prioritize a \nbusiness-led approach to building inclu -\nsive and resilient communities that allows \nus to bring all our resources to bear, \nleveraging initiatives such as the Citi \nImpact Fund, which makes investments in \ncompanies that are addressing societal \nchallenges, with an emphasis on women- \nand minority-owned enterprises.“E for Education” \nIn 2013, we created our “e for education” campaign to raise awareness and funds for  \neducation-focused nonprofits that tackle childhood illiteracy and improve access to \nquality education. During the annual campaign, Citi’s Foreign Exchange business  \ndonates $1 for every $1 million traded on our platforms. The initiative, which also  \nincluded local market bonds, expanded across Futures and Cash Equities for the first \ntime in 2019.

There \nis growing awareness that the climate \nis changing at an unprecedented pace \nand that we’re well beyond the time to \noperate in a business-as-usual mindset. We made a bold, 10-year commitment to finance and facilitate $100 billion in envi -\nronmental finance activities to reduce \nthe impacts of climate change and enable \npositive environmental impact, beginning \nin 2014. We exceeded that goal in 2019 \n— four years ahead of schedule.

Due to increasing and innova -\ntive environmental finance activity in the global market, we were able to reach the \n$100 billion mark in the second quarter of \n2019 and counted a total of $164 billion \nby year’s end. In 2019, several key invest -\nment banking transactions related to renewable energy financing and mergers and acquisitions contributed significant \nleague table credit\n2 to the goal.The marketplace has matured since we \nlaunched the $100 billion goal, which followed a previous $50 billion goal \nthat we completed in 2013. Many of the \nproducts available today — such as green \nbonds and loans, hedging for renewable \nenergy projects and lending linked to \nenvironmental, social and governance \n(ESG) performance — were relatively new \nor even nonexistent just a few years ago. \nThe increasing focus on environmental finance is due to growing efforts by \ncompanies and other organizations to \nestablish sustainability targets and the \nnew and innovative products to help them \nachieve these goals, with an increased \nrecognition of the urgency of the climate \nchallenge and the need for solutions. To \nmeet these needs, we help our clients \nachieve their goals in support of a sustainable global economy. Our $100 billion goal directly supported our mission to provide financial services \nthat enable growth and economic prog -\nress. Each transaction needed to meet at least one of six criteria in order to be \ncounted: renewable energy, water quality \nand conservation, sustainable transporta -\ntion, green building, energy efficiency or clean technology. The activities that met \nthese criteria covered a diverse range of products and services, such as project \nand infrastructure financing, green \nbonds, power purchase agreements and \ntax equity financing, to name a few.\nThe environmental finance projects that counted toward the goal were all core \nbanking activities financed and facilitated \nin partnership with Citi clients. While \nthey certainly added to our own bottom \nline, their value and benefits extended \nto many stakeholders, local communities and the broader global economy.Championing Climate Action\nAs a bank, we have the ability to leverage our financing decisions, our  \nrelationships with our clients and our policies and procedures to drive  \npositive climate action. We also champion climate-positive activities more broadly. In 2019 alone, we became: \n •A signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking, a set of principles that provide a \nframework to achieve a sustainable banking system.\n •A signatory to the joint labor union and CEO “United for Paris Agreement,” reinforcing our commitment and support for the international plan to address climate change and accelerate the actions and investments needed for a sustainable future; this statement built on the “We Are Still In” declaration we signed in 2018 as part of our ongoing support for the Paris Agreement. \n •A signatory to the Guiding Principles for Federal Action on Climate , which set out \nprinciples for long-term federal policy on climate change in the U.S. \n1 For performance against our Sustainable Progress Strategy Scorecard, please see the report Appendices . \n2 A league table is a competitive ranking of banks, companies, industries, geographies or other groups of entities ordered according to a metric (e.g., deal volume, number of deals).Leader in Sustainable Finance \nIn 2019, Citi was ranked second in  \nDealogic’s Corporate Green, Social & \nSustainable Bonds League Table. We were \nalso ranked second in the industry for our \nmunicipal finance activity, which includes \ngreen bonds, by the Thomson Reuters SDC \nLeague Table, and fourth on Bloomberg’s \nGlobal Green Bonds (Corporates & Gov -\nernments) League Table. Additionally, we ranked third for Tax Equity by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\n44\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \n* Transactions fall within multiple categories of reporting.$100 Billion \nEnvironmental Finance Goal: \nFinancial Highlights, \n2014–2019*\n$164 B\nresulted in:A total of\n$122.1 B\nin renewable energy\n$13.1 B\nin water quality and \nconservation$4.6 B\nin green building$24.3 B\nin green bonds**$8.4 B\nin sustainable transportation\n$22.1 B\nin public finance\n3     Climate Bonds Initiative, Bonds and Climate Change: The State of the Market 2018  (September 2018). Environmental Finance in Support of the SDGs\nAccording to a recent report,3 an estimated $90 trillion of investments in climate  \nprojects will be needed by 2030 to combat climate change and achieve the UN  \nSustainable Development Goals. In addition, global green finance must reach  \n$1 trillion by the end of 2020, growing each year thereafter. \nMuch of the work that we counted toward our $100 Billion Environmental Finance \nGoal was most aligned with three of the SDGs: SDG 7, which seeks to ensure access \nto affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all; SDG 11, which aims \nto make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable; \nand SDG 13, which contributes to urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. \nFor example, target 7.2 , to increase the share of renewable energy in the global \nenergy mix by 2030, and target 7. 3 , to double the global rate of energy efficiency \nimprovements by 2030, were both aligned with the objectives of our $100 billion \ngoal. The total financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects account -\ned for $122.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. \nThe $100 billion goal also contributed to SDG target 11.2 — which aims to provide \naccess to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all \n— thanks to our investments in sustainable transit, another of the key criteria of our \ngoal. Financing for sustainable transit projects contributed a cumulative $8.4 billion \ntoward our goal. \nWhile SDG 13 is focused on the wider response to a changing climate, several of our \ninvestments, including municipal bond underwriting and activities supporting water \nquality and conservation projects, delivered on SDG target 13.1 , which aims in part to \nstrengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards. \nSDG GOAL 7: Affordable and Clean Energy \n \nSDG GOAL 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities \n \nSDG GOAL 13: Climate Action \n**  I ncludes the green portion of sustainability bonds when \ninformation is available.\n45\nHow We Reached  \nOur Goal\nTo reach our goal, Citi drew on the \ndiverse expertise of our global banking \nteams to provide our clients with innova -\ntive products and services that finance solutions to address climate challenges.\nTo track transactions and calculate \ntheir contribution toward the goal, we \nused third-party financial sector league \ntable data, which was developed to rank \nfinancial institutions based on their role in \neach transaction and overall activity in the \nmarket. This is aligned with the sector’s method for measuring credit received \nfor business activity. Our methodology is \npublicly available on our website .For the majority of the financial activity \ncounted toward the goal, we used league \ntable accounting credit from Dealogic, \nThomson Reuters and Bloomberg New \nEnergy Finance. For loans or other financial products for which there are no \nestablished league tables, we counted \nthe amount that reflects Citi’s financial \ninvolvement in the deal.\nOur Sustainability & ESG team worked \nclosely with contributing business units \nto track progress toward our $100 billion \ngoal in the following business catego -\nries: Alternative Energy Banking and Financing, Green Bonds, Public Finance, \nCommodities, and Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. Contributing \nBusinesses\nAlternative Energy  \nBanking and Financing\nCiti provides a full range of financing \nsolutions for environmental projects \nglobally, and we continue to develop \ninnovative, end-to-end solutions to meet \nour clients’ unique financing needs. Our \nAlternative Energy Banking and Financing \nteams have developed extensive exper -\ntise in financing solutions for a broad spectrum of renewable energy technol -\nogies, including wind, solar, geothermal \nand biomass. For larger, utility-scale \nprojects, we are able to provide multiple \nservices as a one-stop shop for our \nclients, including construction financing, \ncommodities hedging and tax equity on a \nsingle deal. Citi’s approach to alternative \nenergy and banking products has sparked \nincreased client demand for across-the-\nboard financing solutions. \nCase Study: A Financing Solution for \nNextEra Energy Partners and KKR\nCiti structured a convertible equity \nportfolio financing solution for NextEra \nEnergy Partners (NEP) and KKR & Co., a \nleading global investment firm, to fund \nrenewable development in a unique \nstructure that met the objectives of both clients. Under the agreement, KKR will \nacquire an equity interest in a structured \npartnership with NEP, which owns a \ndiverse portfolio of 10 wind and solar \nprojects in nine U.S. states, collectively \nconsisting of more than 1,100 megawatts \n(mw).\nCiti was one of the leads on the financing \nof this complex, multilayered deal, which \nfeatured an innovative structure with a \nunique buyout option for NEP. The financ -\ning included a funded term loan, delayed-\ndraw term loan and equity margin loan. The World’s First SDG-Linked Bond\nIn 2019, the Italian utility Enel, a leader in the renewable energy space with \nan ambitious decarbonization strategy, launched the world’s first general \npurpose bond linked to the Sustainable Development Goals. This transaction \nis significant as the first general corporate purposes bond to be linked to \nsustainability performance indicators. Citi acted as joint active bookrunner \non the $1.5 billion U.S. bond issue, which offers a unique coupon step-up \nfeature: a one-time interest rate step-up of +25 basis points triggered if the \nrenewable installed energy capacity target of 55 percent is not met by the \nend of 2021.\nAfter the inaugural issuance, Enel launched another SDG-linked bond in the \nEuropean market, raising € 2.5 billion across three tranches. The transaction \nwas almost four times oversubscribed, with total orders of about € 10 billion. \nThe short-dated tranches of four and seven years followed a similar struc -\nture as the USD bond; however, the coupon on the long-dated 15 year was \nlinked to Enel achieving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 equal to or less \nthan 125 grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) per kilowatt hour, also incorporating \na +25 basis point step-up mechanism if the target is not reached. These sustainability KPI-linked bond issuances have set a new precedent in the \ninternational bond market, and we expect several other issuers to adopt this \nstructure in 2020.\n46\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \nGreen, Social and  \nSustainability Bonds\nCiti was one of the largest underwriters \nof green, social and sustainability bonds \nglobally in 2019. These transactions \nhelped our clients raise more than  \n$7.8 billion to meet their environmental, \nsocial and overall sustainability goals. \nCiti co-founded the Green Bond \nPrinciples, which provide issuers with \nguidelines encouraging transparency, \nand we are an active member of its Social Bond Working Group and the \nWorking Group on Climate Transition \nFinance. Through these working groups, \nwe continue to contribute to the further \ndevelopment of the social and sustain -\nable bond market and look to provide further guidance for the emerging \nclimate transition bond market.\nIn early 2019, Citi expanded our leader -\nship role in green bonds and sustainable \nfinancing. We have evolved from one of the co-authors of the Green Bond \nPrinciples to underwriter and now to \nissuer with our inaugural green bond: \na €1 billion, three-year, fixed-rate green \nbond. Through March 2019, Citi issued  \na total of approximately $1.3 billion \nequivalent in green bonds, including \n$143 million equivalent across  \n18 transactions through the structured \nnotes channel. The proceeds of the \ngreen bonds will fund renewable energy, \nsustainable transportation, water quality \nand conservation, energy efficiency \nand green building projects. These \ngreen bond issuances are an important \nmilestone for Citi and demonstrate our \ncommitment to being a leader in financ -\ning sustainable global growth and prog -\nress. They also illustrate Citi’s ability to scale sustainable solutions, respond to \nfast-growing investor demand and drive \nglobal impact in partnerships with our \nclients.  Case Study: Underwriting  \na Green Bond \nIn 2019, Citi acted as a joint lead manager \non a $2 billion, 10-year green bond for \nKfW, the flagship promotional bank of the \nFederal Republic of Germany. The bond \nmarks the largest USD green bond ever issued by any sovereign, supranational \nand agency (SSA) issuer. The orderbook \ncomprised 120 individual investors, \nclosed in excess of $4.8 billion, and was \nunderscored with strong support from \ngreen-motivated investors, who made \nup 58 percent of allocation. This was \nKfW’s first USD-denominated green \nbond following the update of their Green Bond Framework in May 2019 to include \nfunding for energy efficiency projects. \nProceeds from the bond will finance new \neligible green projects within the catego -\nries of renewable energy (including the construction, expansion and acquisition \nof plants generating power or heat from \nrenewable energy sources) and energy \nefficiency (including the construction of new energy-efficient residential \nbuildings).\nPublic Finance \nNational and subnational governments \nare often on the front lines in responding \nto climate change, and Citi provides \nfinancial solutions, including loans and \nbonds, to help them invest in clean water, \ntransportation and energy infrastructure \nto meet the needs of their citizens.\nCiti’s community lending and investing \nactivity also includes financing of \naffordable housing and LEED-certified \naffordable housing projects that were \ncounted toward our $100 billion goal. The affordable housing activity counted \nacross the six years of the goal served \nnearly 6,800 families. Case Study: Supporting a Greener \nBuilding Product\nCiti helped to finance construction \nof the manufacturing plant for the world’s first commercial-scale producer \nof medium density fiberboard (MDF) \nmade from post-harvest rice straw. \nOnce complete, CalPlant will be able to \nsupply approximately 140 million square \nfeet of sustainable high-performance \nno-added-formaldehyde MDF to the \nbuilding products industry. In 2019, Citi \nfinanced $74 million of subordinate lien bonds that were certified “green,” given \nthe project’s environmental aspects. \nThese follow $228 million in green \nbonds Citi financed for CalPlant in 2017. \nCalPlant’s predecessor company, CalAg, \nLLC, spent over 20 years developing and \npatenting a process to make sustainable \nhigh-performance MDF using annually \nrenewable post-harvest rice straw as the \nfeedstock. California’s Sacramento Valley \nis home to approximately 500,000 acres of rice annually. Rice straw, which has \nposed environmental issues in California \nfor more than a century, is an agricul -\ntural waste product of the annual rice harvest.\nHistorically, each year farmers would \ndispose of rice straw by burning the \nstraw. The burning of rice straw produces \nvarious pollutants, which impacted the \nair quality of California’s Central Valley \nduring the straw burning season. More recently, the straw has been disposed \nof by flooding the fields after harvest, \ninitiating a decomposition process. This \npractice uses a large volume of water \nand generates one-half to one ton of \nmethane gas per acre of planted rice \nfrom the rotting straw. By processing the \nstraw into MDF, CalPlant will significantly \nreduce the amount of water that might otherwise be diverted from regional \nwaterways to flood the fields, and, will \nimprove air quality by less straw being \ndecomposed in the flooded fields. \nSacramento Valley rice growers within  \n15 to 25 miles of the plant site are provid -\ning the straw used at the plant. \n47\nTo achieve our goal, we used our environmental criteria to review activity \nfinanced and facilitated in partnership with our clients:\nWe identified activity that counted toward the goal, such as the examples  \nlisted below:\nWe financed environmental solutions around the world:Alternative energy banking \nand finance\n• Wind energy project financing\n• Solar company IPO\n \nGreen bonds\n• Corporate green bond\n• Sovereign green bondWater Quality and \nConservationRenewable  \nEnergyEnergy \nEfficiencyGreen \nBuildingSustainable \nTransportation\n$61.7 B\nNorth America\n$2.2 B\nLatin America$88.9 B\nEurope, Middle \nEast and Africa$4.7 B\nMultiple  \nRegions$164 B\nTotal\n$6.5 B\nAsia Pacific\n11.8 M mt CO2e\navoided emissions198 K\njobs supported  \n(direct, indirect and induced)95 M\npopulation in U.S. cities and counties served by water-quality projects6,869  MW\nnew renewable energy capacity6,792\nfamilies served by green affordable housingThese solutions resulted in measurable impacts:Our $100B Environmental Finance Goal Results\nPublic finance\n• Wind energy power transit bond\n•  LEED-certified affordable housing  \nloan\n \nCommodities\n• Power purchase agreement\n• Monetization of renewable energy creditsConsumer/commercial banking\n• Solar company corporate loanClean  \nTechnology\n48Citi 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nRegion\nNorth America 4.2 11.2 6.7 7.4 24.7 7.4 61.7 38%\n Europe, Middle East and \nAfrica2.4 4.1 7.8 6.7 9.5 58.5 88.9 54%\nAsia Pacific 0.2 0.1 0.5 2.3 2.0 1.3 6.5 4%\nLatin America 0.2 0.5 0.1 0.4 0.4 0.7 2.2 1%\nMultiple Regions 0.5 1.1 0.5 - 1.9 0.6 4.7 3%\nTotal 7.5 16.9 15.6 16.9 38.6 68.6 164.0 100%\nBusiness\n Alternative Energy \nBanking and Finance4.2 11.0 9.0 9.2 24.1 56.7 114.3 70%\nGreen Bonds** 1.8 1.8 1.4 4.4 7.0 7.9 24.3 15%\nPublic Finance 0.7 3.2 4.3 2.9 7.3 3.6 22.1 13%\nCommodities 0.2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.0 0.2 1.6 1%\n Consumer Banking and \nCommercial Banking0.6 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.1 0.1 1.8 1%\nTotal 7.5 16.9 15.6 16.9 38.6 68.6 164.0 100%Environmental Criteria 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total $ Total %\nRenewables 4.9 11.6 9.6 10.9 24.3 60.8 122.1 74%\nSolar 0.8 2.1 0.6 4.9 1.6 1.5 11.5 7%\nWind 3.0 7.9 8.6 4.4 7.4 1.1 32.5 20%\nMixed Renewables 1.1 1.6 0.4 1.6 15.3 58.1 78.1 48%\nEnergy Efficiency 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.4 1.3 1%\nGreen Building 0.4 0.6 0.7 0.3 2.2 0.4 4.6 3%\n Sustainable \nTransportation0.5 1.8 1.6 1.2 1.6 1.7 8.4 5%\n Water Quality and \nConservation0.4 1.2 2.8 1.4 5.3 2.0 13.1 8%\nClean Technology 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.4 0%\nMultiple Criteria 1.1 1.4 0.5 2.9 5.1 3.2 14.2 9%\nTotal 7.5 16.9 15.6 16.9 38.6 68.6 164.0 100%$100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal\nFinancial Data* \nIn billions USD, 2014—2019\n*  F igures may not sum to totals due to rounding.\n**   I ncludes the green portion of sustainability bonds when information is available.Clean  \nTechnology\n49\nCommodities\nCitigroup Energy Inc. (CEI) — Citi’s \nCommodities team and energy trading \ndesk — provides hedges for renewable \nenergy project financing deals, helps \nclients obtain renewable energy credits \nand works on commodities derivatives. \nThese services help enable our clients to \nachieve their financial and environmental \ngoals for renewable energy procurement. \nCEI has also played a role in helping Citi meet our goal to power our facilities with \n100 percent renewable energy by 2020. \nCase Study: Sourcing Renewable Power\nQTS Realty Trust, a leading provider of \ndata centers, signed a 10-year agreement \nto purchase renewable energy to power \n100 percent of its electricity needs for \nits facilities in Chicago and Piscataway, \nNew Jersey. With support from CEI, the \ncompany has also achieved 100 percent \nrenewable energy status for its Irving, \nTexas, data center and plans to expand renewable power initiatives in existing \nand new data centers. In addition to wind \npower, the Piscataway data center also \nfeatures a 14 mw solar farm that supplies \nenergy.\nEnvironmental and \nSocial Impacts Achieved Through  \nOur $100 Billion Goal\nWe recognize that the real-world impacts \nof our financing and lending activities \nare a crucial measure of success, and \nthis certainly applies to the $100 Billion \nEnvironmental Finance Goal. The impacts \nof this goal go much further than just the \ndollar amount of our direct financing. \nWhen we first developed our goal, we \nfelt it was important to try to measure \nand understand the impact — for our \nclients and the communities where we \ndo business. Using stakeholder feedback, we identified a range of impacts — green -\nhouse gas (GHG) emissions avoided, jobs supported and community benefits realized — that we are able to calculate \nfor a subset of the transactions counted \ntoward the goal. As there is no estab -\nlished standard way to measure these impacts, we developed our approach \nfollowing extensive research on a variety \nof best practices. We utilize actual project \ndata or apply a reasonable proxy if \napplicable.\nThis area of work proved to be an \nongoing education for us, where we learned as we went and consistently \nchallenged ourselves to dig deeper. We \nrefined our methodology over the last \nseveral years to better understand the \nimpacts associated with the activity that \ncounts toward our goal. Overall, we took \na conservative approach to reporting \nimpacts and did not include deals in \nwhich we have limited transparency on transaction details. Our impact \nmeasurement methodologies align with \nour accounting approach, reporting our \nshare of the impacts proportional to our \nfinancial share of the transaction. \nTo calculate environmental impacts, \nwe developed models to estimate the \navoided GHG emissions by a subset of \nthe transactions that contributed to the $100 billion goal — specifically, renewable energy financing, energy efficiency \nfinancing and public finance. The esti -\nmated 11.8 million metric tons (mt) of avoided GHG emissions as a result of our \nactivities throughout the duration of the goal is the equivalent of removing more \nthan 2.5 million cars from the road for \none year.\n4 \nFor social impacts, our primary metric is the number of jobs that are supported by a segment of the transactions count -\ning toward the goal, specifically Citi’s financing of U.S.-based renewable energy \nprojects and public finance activity. We \ndeveloped a model, based on an approach \nused by economists and public policy \nexperts, that estimated our contribution \nto supporting U.S. jobs. These calcula -\ntions were based on specific investment \nand expenditure profiles tied to data \naggregated from a number of sources. \nSince 2014, we estimate that more than \n198,000 direct, indirect and induced \njobs were supported by the financing we \nprovide to our clients. \nWe also calculate our direct, indirect \nand induced impact on the U.S. gross \ndomestic product (GDP). We estimate that \nour 2018 and 2019 financing activities \ncontributed approximately $15.7 billion in total to U.S. GDP. Citi financed a U.S. wind and solar project owned by NextEra Energy Partners and KKR.\n4    EPA GHG Equivalencies Calculator, March 2020\n50\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices             \n* Figures may not sum to totals due to rounding.Environmental Impacts 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total\nAvoided GHG Emissions (mt)** 1,360,092 1,740,659 325,676 1,058,809 4,410,701 2,900,418 11,796,355\nRenewable Energy  \nProject Finance1,294,788 1,590,612 180,739 1,057,022 4,317,287 2,846,359 11,286,807\nEnergy Efficiency  \nFinance60,061 145,524 140,149 – 91,199 51,735 488,667\nPublic Finance 2,224 1,672 1,453 1,246 2,215 2,324 11,134\nConsumer/  \nCommercial Banking3,019 2,851 3,335 541 – – 9,746\nRenewable Energy Capacity \nAdded (MW)563 869 278 619 3,154 1,386 6,869\nSocial Impacts 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Total\nJobs Supported*** 11,574 29,494 30,140 22,995 63,932 39,965 198,100\nRenewable Energy Project Finance4,870 8,069 4,378 4,357 9,603 5,528 36,805\nPublic Finance 6,704 21,425 25,762 18,638 54,330 34,437 161,296\nPeople Serviced by Water Quality and Conservation Projects\n211,346 6,916,113 28,831,321 7,617,037 12,363,540 39,476,656 95,416,013\nFamilies Serviced by Affordable Housing Activity1,237 1,004 1,166 1,340 956 1,089 6,792\nTrips on Transit System Projects (in billions)– 3.5 3.1 4.2 3.2 4.2 18.2Impact Data*\n** 2018 Avoided GHG Emissions has been adjusted to reflect  non baseload grid emissions factors consistent with previous reporting years.\n***  2 018 amount of Jobs Supported is revised from previous reporting to accurately reflect our methodology.\n51\nTCFD and Climate Finance Opportunities\nCiti supports the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and its \nrecommendations for improved disclosure regarding the financial impacts of climate- \nrelated risks and opportunities.

What’s Ahead\nWe recognize the severity of the climate \ncrisis and the critical role Citi can play to \nhelp address the significant challenges \nand help our clients seize the opportu -\nnities. We’re proud of the work we’ve done so far, but there is more to do. \nIn partnership with our clients, we are \nembracing the opportunity to develop \ninnovative products and services to \nsupport the transition to a low-carbon economy and to continue our learnings \non the path forward. And, as we learn, \nwe will continue to be transparent, both \nabout our successes and how we are \naddressing challenges.\nOur continuous progress from the earli -\nest days of our sustainability program \n— most recently with the completion \nof our $100 billion goal — represents \nkey milestones in a journey that is far \nfrom over. We have worked to move not \nonly Citi, but the whole financial sector, \nforward, from the Green Bond Principles and the recently launched Poseidon \nPrinciples to our engagement with the \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures and its climate risk assess -\nment recommendations. \nAs we look ahead, we are excited about \nthe opportunities for Citi and our clients \nto drive positive change.

For \ngeneral corporate purposes transactions under our ESRM Policy (categorized as \n“general review”), we evaluate a client’s \nenvironmental and social policies and \nperformance, as well as its commitment \nand capacity to manage environmental \nand social issues. Higher-risk, project- \nrelated transactions also receive in-depth \nreviews by independent environmental \nand social consultants. If gaps are found between a client’s environmental and social plans, policies or practices and international standards, we develop an \nEnvironmental and Social Action Plan \n(ESAP) to fill the gaps. As a condition of \nfinancing, we require the client to imple -\nment the ESAP, and we monitor progress over time. \nWe also monitor the projects we finance \nto ensure the conditions of financing are \nbeing met. For instance, as part of our routine monitoring of a financed manu -\nfacturing plant in Asia, we discovered that while our client’s accommodations for \nconstruction workers met international \nstandards, some of their subcontractors’ \naccommodations did not. We stepped in \nto ensure the conditions were improved \nto meet international standards for \ndecent living conditions and followed up regularly to confirm that progress was being made. As a result, our client took responsibility for the worker accommo -\ndations of their subcontractor and made improvements to bring them up to the \nappropriate standards. \nIn some cases, we must decline to partic -\nipate in a transaction because we do not \nbelieve we can adequately address the \nenvironmental and social risks through \nmitigation measures or because the risks \nare too high. During 2019, for example, \nwe declined participation in an oil and gas exploration project in a biodiverse \ntropical rainforest due to a lack of free, \nprior and informed consent from affected \nindigenous communities, as well as \nimpacts to a critical habitat. We also \ndeclined a transaction for a hydroelectric \nproject in Southeast Asia because of \noverlap with critical habitat for endan -\ngered species. In addition, we declined a \nnumber of early financing opportunities \nrelated to coal-fired power in Latin \nAmerica and Asia based on the standards \nof our ESRM Policy commitment on coal-\nfired power. \nApplying our ESRM Policy helps us \nidentify risks beyond traditional credit \nrisks, guides how we evaluate transac -\ntions related to companies or projects within high-risk sectors and presents \nopportunities for us to advise clients on solutions to thematic risks. To learn \nmore about our ESRM Policy, including \nAreas of High Caution, sector-specific \nstandards and policy prohibitions, see \nour Environmental and Social Policy \nFramework .\n2    The ESRM section of our Environmental and Social Policy Framework outlines the scope of our ESRM Policy, including the types of transactions that trigger a review.ESRM Due Diligence in Action\nIn 2019, we identified environmental risks \nduring due diligence for two potential \nfinancings of industrial facilities in Mexico. \nOne of the planned facilities had the \npotential to negatively impact a critical \nmangrove habitat; the other was planned \nnear an internationally protected wetland \nsite where there were concerns about \neffluent drainage from the project into the \nwetlands. In both cases, we put financing conditions in place requiring the clients to \nengage biodiversity experts and develop \naction plans to avoid these environmental \nrisks. These conditions led to the develop-\nment of biodiversity management plans \nthat were implemented during the con-\nstruction of the facilities. Our ESRM Policy \nis most effective in cases like these, when \nwe are considering financing projects and can include conditions requiring tangible \nactions to improve environmental and \nsocial outcomes.\n55\nMonitoring the \nChanging Risk Landscape \nThe ESRM team uses a number of \nmethods to proactively scan the changing \nrisk landscape for new, emerging risks \nas well as risks with increased promi -\nnence and prevalence. Through internal research and third-party environmental \nand social data, we monitor relevant \ndevelopments in high-risk industries and \nstakeholder concerns to flag emerging \nissues. In recent years, for example, concerns regarding e-cigarettes, opioids, \nprivate prisons and artificial intelligence \nhave become more prominent. Our \nongoing monitoring of these and other \nelevated concerns keeps us responsive to evolving risks, enabling us to raise aware -\nness within Citi about emerging issues \nand helping us identify clients that might \nbe impacted for further engagement. Our risk monitoring feeds into our ESRM \nWatchlist process, through which we flag \nindividual companies based on their track \nrecords, sensitive or controversial assets, \nthird-party sustainability scores and \nnegative news. \nESRM Champions\nOur ESRM Champions are credit risk \nofficers and other employees with \nregional expertise and additional ESRM \ntraining, who serve as bridges between \nour local banking teams and our global \nESRM team. They assist in training their \nlocal, internal teams about our ESRM \nPolicy, engage with regional regulators about new financial regulatory guidance \nrelated to environmental and social risk \nand provide important regional insights that improve our ability to make respon -\nsible lending decisions. For instance, in some countries that are developing \nor have recently adopted regulations \nrequiring banks to develop environmental \nand social risk policies and procedures \n— including Brazil, Ecuador, Honduras, \nParaguay and Peru — our ESRM \nChampions are helping us understand the local context so we can more effectively \nexecute due diligence processes and align \nour implementation.\nClient Engagement \nEngaging our clients is an important part of our ESRM due diligence process. \nInitially, these engagements were tied \nCollaborating to Update  \nthe Equator Principles \nSixteen years after co-founding the  \nEquator Principles (EP), Citi continues to \nhelp strengthen the Principles to ensure \nthey remain relevant. During 2019, we \ncontinued our participation in the EP up-\ndate process, helping to develop the most \nrecent iteration of this global standard \nfor banks evaluating environmental and \nsocial risks of project-related finance. \nThanks to an initiative co-led by Citi, EP now encourages clients to share crucial \nbiodiversity data for all transactions \ncovered by the Principles. This transparen-\ncy helps to improve conservation efforts \naround the world. Citi also co-led the \nsocial risks working group, working hard \nto reach a consensus among all members \non strengthened requirements related to \npotential project impacts on human rights and Indigenous Peoples. The updated \nstandards, known as EP4, were released \nin November 2019 for implementation in \nJuly 2020. Agribusiness Portfolio Review \nDeforestation is a key environmental concern globally, as it leads to habitat \nloss, biodiversity impacts and climate-related risks, among others. In 2019, we \nconducted a portfolio review of our agribusiness clients with a focus on the \nimpacts of deforestation. We developed a questionnaire to gather information \nabout how clients manage deforestation risks in their operations in the global \ntropics, including the tools they use to track deforestation and the certifica -\ntions they use to ensure sustainable practices and processes. \nWe found that one of the most effective ways to decrease deforestation risks \nis through quality sustainability certifications, such as the certification of \nplantations by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, the Forest Stewardship \nCouncil and the Round Table on Responsible Soy. Some of the practices that \nthese certifications ensure include the preservation of high-conservation and \nhigh-carbon-stock forests, the restoration of forests cleared after 2009 and a \nprohibition on using fire to clear lands. \nOur clients’ adoption of certifications in the areas of palm oil, forestry and soy \nin tropical countries has increased in recent years, as has the total area of \ntheir plantations certified. In addition, more companies are actively employing \nnew technologies that enable transparent traceability of their supply chains. These are positive developments, and we are now analyzing the results of this \nportfolio review to inform continued improvement in our ESRM approach to \nthe agribusiness sector. \n56\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nto specific, project-related financial \ntransactions and their associated envi -\nronmental and social risks and mitigation efforts. However, as we have developed \nsector-specific standards over the years, \nwe have added corporate-level reviews \nand client engagements in a   number \nof sectors. These sector-specific risk \nreview processes encourage dialogue \nbetween Citi and our clients about the material environmental and social risks \nassociated with their operations, enabling \nus to develop a better understanding \nof prevailing industry practices and our \nclients’ performance.\nSome examples of client engagement \nactivities in 2019 include ESRM-focused \nsite visits in Colombia and Peru to \nmeet with clients in the oil, mining and \npalm oil industries. We learned how \none mining client was addressing and remediating legacy environmental lead \ncontamination and other environmental \nhealth concerns connected with one of \ntheir mines. Another mining company \ndemonstrated best practices in biodi -\nversity management by successfully restoring a biodiversity corridor after \nmine decommissioning, which fostered \nthe reemergence of local flora and fauna, including jaguars. We also engaged with a palm oil client that has shown impres -\nsive supply chain traceability through \ncertification of their smallholders to \nensure their supply chain is deforesta -\ntion free. These engagements help us learn about emerging best practices for \nmanaging environmental and social risks \nthat can be shared with other clients \nfacing similar challenges. During 2019, \nwe also continued to engage clients in the oil and gas industry on issues related \nto environmental, social and governance \nperformance and climate risk. \nEnhancing Our \nTraining\nEach year, we train key risk and banking \npersonnel on our ESRM Policy. Topics \ninclude environmental and social risks \nrelevant to certain regions and sectors, \nEP implementation and Citi’s Sector \nStandards. The training also includes \nemerging risks and guidance to help \nemployees recognize environmental and \nsocial risk in transactions — ranging from \nclimate change risks to human rights risks to labor concerns and more. In total, \nmore than 590 Citi employees underwent \nESRM training during 2019.Partnership to Protect \nWorkers’ Rights \nUlula is a mobile phone technology \nplatform that facilitates the report -\ning of worker welfare issues, the monitoring of working conditions \nand employee engagement. In 2019, \nwe worked with Ulula to lay the \ngroundwork so that this tool  \ncould be deployed to address labor rights issues for a large infrastruc -\nture project in the Middle East \nbeginning in 2020. This technology \nhas great potential to safeguard the \nrights of migrant workers, enabling \nimmediate reporting of concerns \nusing mobile devices. Ulula has \nreached more than 1 million people \nin 22 countries to help advance \nworker and community engagement \nthrough their inclusive technology and real-time analytics across a \nbroad set of industries.\nPiloting a Policy Chat Bot \nDuring 2019, Citi piloted a new chat bot \nthat provides employees with information \nabout a broad range of issues covered by \nCiti’s risk policies. Our ESRM function pro-\nvided input into the development of the \nchat bot related to the scope of our ESRM \nPolicy. The chat bot pilot is designed \nto test ways to make Citi policies more \naccessible to employees, and, in the case \nof the ESRM Policy, to help them better determine whether a specific transaction \nor client review requires engagement with \nthe ESRM team. \n57\nClimate-Related Risk\nClimate change is one of the most critical \nissues facing society today. Actions must \nbe taken to transition to a low-carbon \neconomy and address the climate-related \nrisks that are already being felt in many \nregions and industries to avoid the \nworst impacts of climate change. As a \nfinancier of the global economy, we are \nkeenly aware of the seriousness and \nurgency of climate change and how it may affect the world. In response, we are \nassessing the impacts of climate change \non our portfolios, and then, informed \nby this deepened understanding, we are \nworking to enable the transition toward \na low-carbon economy. This section \ndelves into our risk-related activities. For \na broader overview of Citi’s approach to \nclimate-related issues, see Citi’s Support for Climate Action .Climate Risk Analysis\nCiti’s ESRM Policy sets a framework to assess the potential climate risks \nand impacts of the clients and projects \nthat we finance. Our project-related \nfinance approach aligns with the Equator \nPrinciples, including an alternatives anal -\nysis of less carbon-intensive technologies for all transactions that exceed 100,000 \ntons of carbon dioxide emissions and a \nrisk assessment of negative impacts from physical climate risk. \nOur ESRM Policy also includes Sector \nStandards that cover carbon-intensive \nsectors such as coal mining, coal-fired \npower, forestry, oil and gas and palm oil, \nthat have a greater impact on climate \nchange and are more exposed to climate \ntransition risks. With the help of our \ncross-functional Climate Risk Working Group, the ESRM team is developing more comprehensive internal guidance \nto evaluate the climate risk of specific \nsectors for integration into the broader \nrisk analysis of clients. More information \nabout our ESRM Sector Standards are \navailable in our Environmental and Social \nPolicy Framework . \nClimate risk analysis methodologies, tools, data and scenarios continue to \nrapidly improve and advance. As the \nexpectations on banks to understand their portfolio-wide climate risk continue \nto increase, Citi is taking steps to further \nintegrate climate risk considerations \ninto our risk management approach \nbeyond the scope of the ESRM Policy. \nWe remain committed to participating \nin industry collaborations, monitoring \ndevelopments and experimenting with \ndifferent approaches to help us enhance our understanding and capacity for \naddressing climate-related risks and \nopportunities.\nFor a discussion of Citi’s Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures \n(TCFD) implementation, please see our \n2018 TCFD report, \nFinance for a Climate-\nResilient Future , and the Citi’s Support for \nClimate Action section of this report.\nReducing Credit  \nExposure to Coal\nThe shift away from fossil fuels to \nrenewable energy will have a significant \neffect on both coal mining and coal-fired \npower production. Since 2015, Citi has \nhad a commitment to reduce our credit \nexposure to the coal mining industry \nand conduct enhanced due diligence on \nour coal mining clients’ environmental \nand social policies and performance. \nThe effort applies globally to companies generating a majority of their revenues \nfrom coal mining activities and to coal- \nfocused subsidiaries of diversified mining \ncompanies. As a result of our commit -\nments and related activities, we have successfully reduced our credit exposure \nin recent years. Analysis of Clean Energy Scenarios  \nIn 2019, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (Citi GPS) released its report \nEnergy Darwinism III: The Electrifying Path to Net Zero Carbon . The report \nnotes that significant reductions in future carbon dioxide emissions can be \nachieved through the electrification of transport and industry as we move \naway from fossil fuel use and toward clean energy alternatives. Using Citi’s \nGlobal Integrated Energy & Emissions Framework it provides an analysis of \nlikely impacts if the global community maintains its current level of energy use \ncompared with the impacts and tradeoffs that could occur if we pursue differ -\nent energy use scenarios. \nIncreased electrification from clean energy poses undeniable risks for the fossil \nfuel industry. The Citi GPS report delves into the implications for the oil and \ngas and coal industries, showcasing the variables at play and the complexity \ninherent in charting a course forward. In relation to our own business, quanti -\nfying short-term and long-term risk for these industries remains a high priority \nas we manage our energy portfolio and reduce our exposure to industries that \ncarry significant risk. \nOf course, risk is only one side of the equation. The transition also creates \nnew opportunities. For more information about how Citi embraces investment \nopportunities related to clean energy and other sustainable solutions, see the \nEnvironmental Finance section . \n58\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nDuring 2019, we made progress imple -\nmenting our new ESRM Policy commitment \non coal-fired power, which prohibits any \nfinancing for the construction or expan -\nsion of coal-fired power plants. The restric -\ntion includes transactions supporting the \nsupply of all components, equipment, \nmaterials and services directly required \nfor the construction of such plants. The \nonly exception that may be considered is for proposed ultra-supercritical plants that \naddress situations of energy poverty (i.e., \nin countries where the national electrifica -\ntion rate is 90 percent or below according to the annual \nEnergy Progress Report ) and \nalign with the host country’s Nationally \nDetermined Contribution under the Paris \nAgreement. Since the implementation of \nthe policy, no transactions that we have \nreviewed have met this exception criteria. \nIn 2019, we declined five opportunities \nfor financing during the early stages of \nengagement as a result of this policy \nrestriction. \nIn support of our new commitments, we \nare reviewing our power-sector clients with coal-fired generation to evaluate \ntheir greenhouse gas (GHG) tracking, \nreporting and reduction strategies and \ntheir management of risks and opportu -\nnities related to a low-carbon transition. We want to understand how they are \nintegrating climate risk analysis into their \nbusiness strategy, if they have plans \nfor diversification away from coal-fired power sources and whether they are \ndeveloping low-carbon transition strat -\negies to align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. \nAs we help our clients transition away \nfrom coal, we consult external frame -\nworks and initiatives such as the Edison Electric Institute’s environmental, social, \ngovernance and sustainability template \nand the Transition Pathway Initiative. \nWe also identify clients that have demonstrated success in transitioning \naway from coal as well as clients that \nare experiencing challenges. Through \nengagement with diverse clients, we \nshare best practices and encourage open \ndialogue to support the energy transition. Cross-Industry  \nCollaboration on  \nClimate Risk in  \nMaritime Shipping\nGHG emissions from the maritime ship -\nping industry are expected to increase \nover time to keep up with expanding \nglobal trade. As industries transition \nto low-carbon alternatives, maritime \nshipping will need to do the same or face \nsignificant financial risks. Our influence \nand investment in this sector give us an \nopportunity to advance initiatives that \npromote responsible lending and acceler -\nate financing to support this transition. \nWorking in collaboration with other \nbanks and organizations within the \nshipping industry, Citi helped to develop \nand was a founding signatory of the \nPoseidon Principles . Released in 2019, \nthese Principles provide a framework for lenders, lessors and financial guarantors \nto integrate climate considerations into \nlending decisions with international \nshipping clients to help the sector decarbonize in line with the goals of the \nInternational Maritime Organization. \nAs a part of our commitment under the \nPoseidon Principles, we will be measuring \nand disclosing the carbon intensity of our \nshipping portfolio on an annual basis. We \nexpect to publish our first disclosure in \nalignment with these Principles in 2020.\nCiti is also a member of the Getting to \nZero Coalition, which is focused on the \ndevelopment of commercially viable, zero-emission vessels and other needed \nmaritime infrastructure for scalable net- \nzero-carbon energy sources, including \nproduction, distribution, storage and \nbunkering. Launched during Climate \nWeek NYC in September 2019 with over \n100 coalition members and supported \nby 14 governments, this coalition is coor -\ndinated by the Global Maritime Forum, \nFriends of Ocean Action and the World \nEconomic Forum.  What’s Ahead\nAddressing the risks associated with \nclimate change is a priority for Citi and \nfor our key stakeholders, including \nclients, investors and regulators. In an \neffort to better understand how the \ntransition and physical risks of climate \nchange may affect our business, our \nclients, our communities and the global \neconomy, we are continuing to explore \nnew methodologies and tools that assess and measure these risks — as well \nas potential opportunities. It is incum -\nbent upon all sectors to contribute to solutions that limit warming to no more \nthan 2°C, with a goal of staying below \n1.5°C, above pre-industrial levels. As a \nresult, we expect that climate-related \nrisks and opportunities will be a growing \npriority for our clients in all sectors, not just for those in the fossil fuel and other \ntraditionally carbon-intensive industries. \nIn 2020 we will continue to test emerg -\ning climate risk assessment methodol -\nogies to better understand the climate \nrisk faced by Citi and our clients, and we \nwill continue to engage our clients on \nthe transition to a low-carbon economy. \nIn addition, 2020 will be a key year for \nbiodiversity and implementing the new \nEP4. As a leader in developing the guid -\nance note on Biodiversity Data Sharing for EP4, Citi will be working with partners and other banks that have adopted the \nEquator Principles to raise awareness \nand train clients on how to share crit -\nical biodiversity data that is gathered during project design and operational \nmonitoring.\n59\n2019 Projects Covered by the Equator Principles\nAs part of our commitment to the Equator Principles (EP),  \nwe report annually on our implementation. \nCategory A — Projects likely to have potential significant \nadverse social or environmental impacts that are diverse, irreversible or unprecedented\nCategory B — Projects likely to have potential limited \nadverse social or environmental impacts that are few in number, generally site-specific, largely reversible and readily addressed through mitigation measures\nCategory C — Projects likely to have minimal or  \nno social or environmental impactsFunded EP Project \nFinance Loans\nFunded Project Finance Loans Breakdown\nFunded EP Project Finance AdvisoriesTotal = 4A\nTotal = 6 Total = 10 1 1\n3 5 0\n1 0 0Funded EP Project- \nRelated Corporate  and Bridge LoansFunded EP Project Finance Advisories\nFunded Project-Related Corporate and Bridge Loans BreakdownB\nC\nBy Sector A B C Total\nInfrastructure - - 1 1\nOil, Gas and Petrochemicals - 1 - 1\nPower — Wind - 2 - 2\nBy Sector A B C Total\nPulp and Paper 1 - - 1\nBy Region A B C Total\nLatin America 1 - - 1\nBy Country Designation A B C Total\nDesignated* - - - 0\nNon-designated** 1 - - 1By Sector A B C Total\nInfrastructure - 1 - 1\nManufacturing - 1 - 1\nOil, Gas and Petrochemicals 1 1 - 2\nPower — Gas and Diesel - 1 - 1\nPower — Wind - 1 - 1By Region A B C Total\nAsia Pacific - - - 0\nEurope - - - 0\nLatin America - 1 - 1\nMiddle East and Africa - - - 0\nU.S. and Canada - 2 1 3By Region A B C Total\nAsia Pacific 1 1 - 2\nEurope - 1 - 1\nLatin America - 2 - 2\nMiddle East and Africa - - - 0\nU.S. and Canada - 1 - 1By Country Designation A B C Total\nDesignated* - 2 1 3\nNon-designated** - 1 - 1 By Country Designation A B C Total\nDesignated* - 2 - 2\nNon-designated** 1 3 - 4By Independent Review A B C Total\nYes - 3 - 3\nNo - - 1 1 By Independent Review A B C Total\nYes 1 3 - 4\nNo - 2 - 2\n*   D esignated Countries as defined by the Equator Principles are high-income \nOECD countries.

We \nengage human rights experts, clients \nand peers to help implement our respect \nfor human rights in line with the UN \nGuiding Principles on Business and \nHuman Rights — a global framework Human Rights\nOur work to uphold human rights extends across our \nvalue chain. We create and maintain policies and stan -\ndards that protect our employees, guide our suppliers \nand inform our business decisions — including what \nwe choose to finance and the conditions we place on that financing. Through risk analysis, due diligence and regular engagement with stakeholders, we ensure that \nhuman rights considerations are taken into account \nacross our business.Recognition of Firearms Policy\nReceived award for our U.S. Commercial \nFirearms Policy from the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence\nPage 66Financial inclusion for survivors\nJoined a coalition to help survivors of \nmodern slavery and human trafficking gain access to financial services \nPage 63HIGHLIGHTS\n62\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nfor preventing and addressing the risk \nof adverse impacts on human rights \nlinked to business activity. The UN \nGuiding Principles draw upon existing \ninternational human rights instruments \nwhose principles we endorsed years \nago, such as those in the UN Universal \nDeclaration of Human Rights and the \nInternational Labour Organization’s Core \nConventions regarding child labor, forced labor, freedom of association, the right \nto organize and bargain collectively, and \nequal pay and nondiscrimination in the \nworkforce. To increase transparency, we \nhave prepared this Environmental, Social \nand Governance Report in accordance \nwith the UN Guiding Principles Reporting \nFramework (see UNGP index ).\nCiti regularly updates our policies and practices to strengthen our human \nrights due diligence. During the devel -\nopment and subsequent updates of \nour Statement on Human Rights , which \nwe first adopted in 2007, we engaged internal and external stakeholders to help \nassess our actual and potential adverse \nhuman rights impacts and to identify the \nmost salient human rights risks faced by \nour employees, workers connected to our \nsupply chain and individuals who might be impacted by our clients’ operations. \nWe published the most recent update to \nour Statement on Human Rights in late \n2018. \nIn addition, Citi’s Environmental and \nSocial Risk Management (ESRM) Policy, \nadopted in 2003 and summarized in \nour Environmental and Social Policy \nFramework , guides our approach to \nassessing environmental and social issues related to financing our clients’ business activities. For more information about our \nESRM Policy and related due diligence \nprocesses, see the ESRM section  of this \nreport.\nEach year, we publish a UK Modern \nSlavery Act transparency statement \nsummarizing our approach to identify -\ning and mitigating the risks of modern slavery in our operations — including client transactions — and in our supply chain. It covers information about our \ngovernance and policies related to \nmodern slavery, risk assessment and due \ndiligence processes, and training. \nAnalysis and feedback from third parties \nprovide valuable perspective as we work \nto improve our policies and practices in \nthis area. In November 2019, BankTrack \nreleased its third Human Rights \nBenchmark  for global banks. The bench -\nmark scored 50 global banks according \nto criteria based on the UN Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and Human Rights. \nOur policies, processes and reporting \nhelped us achieve “frontrunner” status in \nthe benchmark, the only U.S. bank to do \nso. However, the benchmark shows that \nimprovement is needed across the indus -\ntry, including by Citi, to make a measur -\nable difference in the lives of people around the world who are affected by \nour financing activities. We will continue \nto improve and consistently implement \nour due diligence processes, revisit our \ncommitments regularly, updating them \nas needed, and provide transparent \ndisclosure to drive progress in respect for \nhuman rights across the financial sector. \nOur Salient Human  \nRights Risks \nHuman rights is one of our most material \nenvironmental, social and governance \n(ESG) issues . We have spent more than \na decade working on the most salient human rights risks related to our busi -\nness — those that pose the greatest risk to people — including the activities of our \nclients and other business partners. We \nidentified most of these risks under our \nESRM Policy as “Areas of High Caution” several years before the advent of the \nUN Guiding Principles. To identify these \nareas, we focused on the most severe \npotential risks posed to people by our \nclients’ activities, particularly in the \ncontext of project finance. Our work \nto address these risks has included \nhelping to found and govern the Equator Principles  (EP) framework to enhance and \nstandardize risk management across the banking sector, establishing an internal \nESRM team, and developing our risk \nidentification and mitigation policies and \nprocedures. (See page 66 for more about \nhow we manage these risks.)\nFinancial Access for \nSurvivors of Modern \nSlavery and Human \nTrafficking\nIn September 2019, the UN \nFinancial Sector Commission \non Modern Slavery and Human \nTrafficking released its final report, \nUnlocking Potential: A Blueprint \nfor Mobilizing Finance Against \nSlavery and Trafficking . It also \nlaunched Finance Against Slavery \nand Trafficking (FAST), a new project intended to help survivors \nof modern slavery and human \ntrafficking gain access to financial \nservices. FAST is a coalition of 12 \nleading banks, including Citi, and \nsix survivor service organizations in \nNorth America and Europe. FAST’s Survivor Inclusion Initiative aims \nto help survivors facing barriers \nto financial access, such as having \ntheir identification documents \nconfiscated by traffickers or having \ntheir identity or financial informa -\ntion hijacked for money laundering purposes. The Survivor Inclusion \nInitiative provides financial institu -\ntions, service providers, regulators, \ngovernmental actors and other key \nstakeholders with a framework to \nmatch identified survivors to basic \nfinancial services, such as checking \nand savings accounts as well as \ndebit cards. \n63\nWhile our formal risk management \nprocesses give us more leverage when we \nare directly financing a project, we also \nidentify and address human rights risks \nthat could arise across our value chain. In \nthe most recent update to our Statement \non Human Rights, we formally recognized \nmany of those issues as salient human \nrights risks for our company, including \ndiscrimination in employment practices and the provision of financial services; \nadequate standard of living and right \nto property; the need to safeguard the privacy of information shared with us by our employees and customers; and more. \nCiti has longstanding policies, procedures \nand programs to address these issues.\nOur handling of salient human rights \nrisks is regularly communicated to senior \nmanagement and our Board of Directors. \nFor more information about our gover -\nnance of ESG issues, including human rights, see the ESG Governance at Citi \nsection . Respecting the  \nHuman Rights of  Our Employees \nEvery Citi employee is expected to adhere \nto our Code of Conduct , which includes \na commitment to human rights, and to participate in relevant training. Our Code \nof Conduct prohibits unlawful discrimi -\nnation, harassment and other behaviors that infringe on individual rights. This \npolicy applies to all employees, as well \nas to suppliers, clients and community \npartners globally.\nEfforts to promote diversity and inclu -\nsion are not always discussed in terms \nof human rights, but they are human \nrights concerns, as they seek to protect \nindividuals from unlawful discrimination \non the basis of essential characteristics \nthat relate directly to a person’s sense of \ndignity. These efforts also aim to remedy \ndisparities in the treatment of women and \nminorities in the workplace. Respect for \ndiversity and inclusion is a high priority wherever we operate and can become \na particular concern in countries where \nthere is no legal protection against \ndiscrimination based on gender, gender \nidentity, race, ethnicity, age, religion, \nphysical or mental disability or medical \ncondition, or sexual orientation, in \naddition to a range of other essential \ncharacteristics inherent to identity and personhood. Citi prohibits discrimination \nand harassment of our employees in all \nforms regardless of whether individual \nprotections are legally mandated in the \ncountries and communities where we \noperate. In fact, we know that even in \nlocations where anti-discrimination laws \nexist, there is still a need for companies \nto ensure they are doing their part to respect individual rights.\nDuring 2019 we raised the minimum wage \nof our U.S.-based employees to $15 an \nhour. We also continued our study of pay \nequity across the company to identify \ngaps in pay between men and women Salient Human Rights Risks: Stakeholder Impacts\nThis table illustrates which stakeholders could be impacted by the human rights risks \nwe have identified as most salient to our company, including risks related to our own \noperations and the activities of our clients. Shaded risks are categorized as Areas of \nHigh Caution and trigger additional due diligence for project transactions in alignment \nwith our ESRM Policy. Additional context about these risks and the due diligence \nprocesses we have in place to identify and mitigate human rights risks in our value \nchain can be found throughout this report, in our Statement on Human Rights and in \nour Environmental and Social Policy Framework . \nHuman Rights RisksCiti’s \nEmployeesSuppliers’ \nEmployeesCustomers  \nand ClientsThose Affected by \nClients’ Projects\nAdequate standard of living;  \nright to property\nConflict risk\nDiscrimination in the provision  \nof financial services\nDiversity and inclusion; \ndiscrimination in the workplace\nIndigenous Peoples\nInformation security; privacy\nLabor practices  \n(including modern slavery)\nResettlement\nSecurity practices\n64\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nglobally and minorities and nonminorities \nin the U.S. Learn more about our pay gap \nanalyses and broader diversity and inclu -\nsion efforts in the Talent and Diversity section . \nFreedom of Association\nWhile the financial services industry is \nnot heavily unionized, we do have unions \nor work councils in many of the countries \nwhere we operate. Approximately  \n12 percent of our employee population \nis covered by collective bargaining \nagreements. We engage directly with \nour employees and through these asso -\nciations to discuss issues such as health and safety, remuneration, work hours, training, career development, work \ntime flexibility and equal opportunity. \nInformation related to freedom of asso -\nciation is communicated to employees through various mediums, including \nemployee handbooks, our intranet and \nemployee emails.\nExtending Respect  \nfor Human Rights Through Our Suppliers and Partners\nOur nondiscrimination policies extend \nto Citi’s and the Citi Foundation’s phil -\nanthropic activity and to Citi’s suppliers. We do not provide funding to organiza -\ntions that discriminate on the basis of personal characteristics, such as gender, \nrace and sexual orientation, among \nothers. We communicate our approach \nto human rights to our suppliers in our \nStatement of Supplier Principles . Our \napproach is reinforced by our Corporate \nResponsibility Questionnaire (CRQ), which \nhelps our procurement team determine \nhow well potential and current suppli -\ners manage environmental and social sustainability issues, including human \nrights issues. Our CRQ for the Europe, \nMiddle East and Africa (EMEA) region \nincludes questions specific to modern slavery concerns, and we are planning to \nimplement these questions across other \nregions as well.\nIn 2017, we conducted an assessment \nof our Tier 1 suppliers at certain spend thresholds in EMEA to assess modern \nslavery-related risks. Following that \nassessment, we have been engaging \nsuppliers deemed of greatest risk to \nbetter understand their approach to \nmanaging these risks. In 2018, we initi -\nated a pilot for our highest-risk suppliers in the following sectors: building services, \ncleaning services and supplies, catering services, and ground transportation \nand other transportation sectors. We \nexpanded this work in 2019 to target 219 \nsuppliers with enhanced due diligence \nquestions about their specific policies \nand procedures to identify, prevent and \nmitigate risks of modern slavery in their \noperations and supply chains. We are \nusing the responses we received from this initial group of high-risk suppliers \nto develop a methodology for assessing \nand categorizing the quality of the \ninformation provided. We will then roll \nout the program globally to enable the screening and escalation of higher-risk suppliers for further engagement in a \nconsistent fashion across our regional \nsourcing teams. More information about \nour efforts to combat modern slavery is \navailable in our 2019 UK Modern Slavery \nAct transparency statement .  \nThe work we do to fight modern slavery \nthroughout our value chain, along with \nour related reporting, policies, due \ndiligence and risk assessments, demon -\nstrates Citi’s commitment to SDG 8 , \nwhich aims to promote sustained, inclu -\nsive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and \ndecent work for all. In particular, our \nwork in these areas addresses target 8.7,  \nwhich includes a mandate to eradicate \nforced labor, end modern slavery and \nhuman trafficking and end child labor in \nall its forms.\nSDG Goal 8:  Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth\nFor more information on our supply chain, see the Operations and Supply \nChain section .\nCalling for Inclusion  \nof Refugees \nIn 2019, we reinforced our commit -\nment to refugees by signing the \nBusiness Refugee Action Network’s \nstatement on the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals . The statement \nadvocates for the inclusion of refugees to make progress toward \nthe SDGs and recognizes the critical \nrole of business to ensure they \nare not left behind. Citi and the Citi Foundation have a history of \nsupporting refugees through finan -\ncial inclusion programs as well as with business training and start-up \nThe Vice Chairman of Citigroup and Chairman \nof Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory \njoined business leaders and journalists at the UN General Assembly to demand action and draw attention to the lack of refugee inclusion \nin the SDGs. \ngrants. By signing this statement, we \njoin with other businesses and organi -\nzations to call for action to improve the lives of refugees. \n65\nRespecting Human \nRights in Our Financing Decisions\nThe challenge of effectively evaluating \nhuman rights risks related to our clients \nand the projects we finance is significant. \nWe work diligently to meet this challenge \nand respect the human rights of the \nindividuals and communities impacted by \nthe projects we finance.\nOur U.S. Commercial Firearms Policy, \nadopted in 2018, is one example of \nhow Citi can have an influence on the \nprotection of human rights. Under this \npolicy, we require clients or partners that are U.S. firearms retailers or firearms \nmanufacturers that sell through U.S. \nretail channels to adhere to a set of best \npractices regarding the sale of firearms. \nFor retailers, these practices include \nselling firearms only to individuals who \nhave completed a background check, not selling high-capacity magazines or bump stocks (which modify semiautomatic fire -\narms to fire faster, at rates comparable to fully automatic firearms), and selling \nfirearms to individuals under age 21 only \nif they have received firearms safety \ntraining (e.g., as part of active or former \nmilitary or law enforcement employ -\nment or via hunter safety training). For manufacturers, best practice entails only selling firearms to retailers who are \nfollowing these same practices. \nAnother opportunity we have to thwart \nhuman rights abuses is through our anti-\nmoney laundering efforts , which help us \nprevent criminally sourced funds — includ -\ning funds associated with human rights \nabuses, such as human trafficking — from \npassing through our bank. Disrupting the flow of money to those perpetrating \nhuman rights abuses and denying those \nabusers safe harbor for illicit proceeds \ntied to corruption or human rights viola -\ntions are effective ways to undermine their efforts.\nWhile these two examples illustrate our \nability to proactively avoid business \ntransactions with adverse human rights impacts, there are other situations in \nwhich the link between our financial \nservices and adverse human rights \nimpacts is less direct. That complexity \nmay mean we have less leverage, and \nit diminishes our ability to ensure that \non-the-ground outcomes are consistent \nwith Citi’s values. In these instances, we \nwork to improve our clients’ awareness and business practices. In addition, \nwhere a transaction’s financial and legal \nstructure allows it, we put loan covenants \nin place and monitor mitigation efforts \nthrough ESRM systems and corrective \naction plans.\nHuman Rights Due \nDiligence in Client \nTransactions\nCiti has thousands of corporate and insti -\ntutional clients. The UN Guiding Principles \nacknowledge the challenges posed by having such extensive business relation -\nships, and we have adopted the approach set out in the Principles of prioritizing our \ndue diligence and risk mitigation first to \nareas where the risk of adverse human \nrights impact is most significant from \nthe perspective of people who could be \naffected. We use our ESRM Policy, where \napplicable, to assess and manage risks \nconsistently and evaluate client projects and activities against a common set \nof environmental and social standards \ngrounded in international best practice, \nincluding human rights norms and the \nInternational Finance Corporation’s \nPerformance Standards. \nOur ESRM team screens transactions \ncovered by our ESRM Policy during the \ninitial marketing phase to identify any \nclient activities we believe pose height -\nened risks to workers or local commu -\nnities. Our policy prohibits financing \nany project for which our due diligence \nindicates a risk of harmful or exploitative \nforms of forced labor or child labor or when the relevant labor forces have \nbeen subjected to human trafficking. In \naddition, the policy covers Areas of High \nCaution — heightened environmental and \nsocial risks that require closer due dili -\ngence and additional risk management. These are issues we have identified as \nsalient human rights risks related to our \ncorporate and investment banking clients’ activities. They include the following: \n •Conflict risk:  Certain sectors may \npresent a greater degree of proj -\nect-induced conflict risk, which may be tied to competition for resources \nor land. In such cases, Citi carefully \nassesses key conflict factors such as \nsources of tension and root causes \nof conflict, actors and their inter -\nests, and development needs and incentives to address such risk in the project’s area of influence.\n •Indigenous Peoples:  Various con -\ncerns can arise regarding the extent \nto which indigenous communities are \nconsulted during project develop -\nment and have consented to impacts Recognition of Our Work  \nto End Gun Violence\nIn 2019, Citi received the Corporate Action \nAward from the Brady Center to Prevent \nGun Violence during the first-ever Brady \nAction Awards. The award was in recog-\nnition of Citi’s U.S. Commercial Firearms \nPolicy, which enforces a set of best \npractices for our U.S. clients and partners \nregarding the sale of firearms. Citi contin-\nues to support the Second Amendment to \nthe U.S. Constitution and the rights of Citi customers to purchase firearms. At the \nsame time, in response to horrific acts of \ngun violence in our communities, we also \nrecognized our responsibility to establish \nthis policy, which includes common-sense \nprovisions for the responsible sale of \nfirearms. The elements of the policy have \nstrong bipartisan support and are backed \nby many gun owners.  \n66\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nto their land, livelihood and cultural \nheritage.\n •Labor: There are risks related to labor forces used in the construction \nof projects or other operations, \nincluding risks associated with forced \nlabor, child labor and human traffick -\ning by project operators and their subcontractors.\n •Resettlement:  The resettlement \nof local communities, including indigenous groups, can be necessary \nfor project implementation. When \nthis occurs, it should be conducted \nthrough carefully designed resettle -\nment action plans that are reviewed by project lenders in advance \nof implementation and should, \nwhere necessary, include efforts toward achieving the free, prior and \ninformed consent of indigenous \ncommunities.\n •Security practices: Security concerns can arise relating to how \nproject sponsors engage with public \nor private security forces protecting \nproject sites. In such circumstances, \nif we decide to proceed with financ -\ning, we will advise project sponsors on the implementation of interna -\ntional standards, such as those in the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.\nIf, during our initial screening or more \nextensive due diligence for a transac -\ntion, we find there is a risk of adverse impacts, we carefully evaluate the client’s \ncurrent commitment and capacity to avoid, mitigate and/or manage those \nimpacts in accordance with international \nindustry best practices and human rights \nnorms and their willingness to engage in \ncontinual learning and improvement. We \nescalate the most challenging cases with \nthe potential for severe adverse impacts \nto senior business and risk managers \nfor collective discussion on the risks and the client’s commitment and capacity. \nIn some cases, senior management will \nconclude that the likelihood for adverse \nimpacts is too great — posing an imminent threat to people or communities — and we \nwill re-evaluate the client relationship or \ndecline involvement in the transaction. \nThis is a move we take very seriously \nas we recognize that terminating the \nrelationship can have a number of ramifi -\ncations, including removing any leverage we might otherwise have had to improve \npractices over time through constructive \nengagement.\nAfter the financial close of project-  \nrelated transactions that have time-  \nbound environmental and social action \nplans, we monitor the project sponsor’s \nimplementation of those actions through \nthe construction and operation phases of \nthe project — often through the retention \nof an independent environmental and \nsocial risk consultant who periodically \nreports to lenders following on-the-\nground audits. For more information,  \nsee the ESRM section .Transactions Reviewed \nUnder Citi’s Statement on \nHuman Rights\nIn 2019, the ESRM team screened 557 \ntotal transactions during the initial \nmarketing phase, and of those, 44 were \nflagged as requiring additional due \ndiligence for human rights risks. This \nscreening does not include other human \nrights risk assessments the ESRM team \nundertakes as part of annual client \nreviews or portfolio reviews. The specific \ntypes of risks we uncovered are outlined in the table below. Of the 44 transactions \nflagged for additional human rights due \ndiligence, 18 proceeded to close after \nwe confirmed the clients were managing \nand mitigating the potential risk appro -\npriately. Transactions may not reach financial close for a number of reasons, \nnot solely due to ESRM review.\nHuman Rights Risks Reviewed in 2019 Closed in 2019\nConflict Risk 8 2\nIndigenous Peoples 17 6\nLabor Risks 9 6\nResettlement 8 4\nSecurity Practices 7 1\nWater 4 1\nTotal Transactions 44 18Identifying Human Rights Risks in Transactions*\n* One transaction may have more than one human rights risk.\n67\nProviding Access to \nRemedy\nThe UN Guiding Principles call on \ngovernments and companies to play their \nrespective roles in ensuring that victims \nof human rights abuse have access to \neffective remedies. Remedy can take \nmany different forms, including apolo -\ngies, financial or nonfinancial compen -\nsation or efforts to prevent future harm \nthrough policy commitments and changes \nin operational practice. The purpose of remedy is to help make victims whole \nagain or to restore them, as much as possible, to their lives and enjoyment \nof their rights before those rights were \nviolated. Remedy can also help ensure \nthat they and others will not suffer similar \nharm in the future.\nAs a financial institution, our approach \nto remedy usually involves working with \nclients to ensure they have the right \npolicies in place and channels available \nto enable victims to lodge grievances. In \naddition, these companies must follow \nup on allegations and have established processes to offer remedies or cooperate \nwith authorities to make sure effective \nremedy is provided. \nContinuous Learning\nEngaging Stakeholders\nTo ensure that we are living up to our commitment to respect human rights \nand anticipate emerging risks, we \nregularly communicate our approach \nexternally and engage with stakeholders \non their issues of concern. During 2019, \nwe participated in a project to improve \nmetrics related to human rights reporting \nthrough Shift . Citi also acted as co-lead \nfor the EP Social Risk working group, \nwhich developed new language and \nguidance on both protection of the rights \nof Indigenous Peoples and human rights \nrisk assessment.\nIn addition, we pay close attention to \nhuman rights issues raised by stakehold -\ners within specific industries, such as the energy sector and palm oil. We engage \nwith these industries directly through \nclient relationships, stakeholder meetings \nand active participation in groups. For instance, our participation in the RSPO \nenables us to engage with multiple \nstakeholders connected to the palm oil \nvalue chain in the hopes of enhancing \nour leverage and improving the collective \neffort of those connected to particular \ncommodities or risks. While in recent years banks have come under increasing pressure to disclose \nspecific findings related to client projects, \nwe are bound by legal requirements and \nbusiness ethics related to confidentiality \nthat limit our ability to disclose such \ninformation without client consent. \nAddressing requests for transparency will \ncontinue to be a balancing act between \nprotecting the confidentiality of our clients’ information and disclosing infor -\nmation to stakeholders as appropriate to advance the protection of human rights. \nIn 2019, we responded both informally \nand in writing to a variety of human \nrights inquiries regarding our financing \nactivities and our general due diligence \npractices. These inquiries came from \nnongovernmental organizations such as BankTrack, the Business and Human \nRights Resource Centre, the Investor \nAlliance for Human Rights and the Sierra \nClub.\nReporting Mechanisms  \nfor Stakeholders\nOur Ethics Hotline provides a way for our \nemployees, suppliers and other external \nstakeholders, including the general \npublic, to report concerns about uneth -\nical behavior to Citi’s Ethics Office. This includes human rights-related issues such \nas workplace harassment, violations of \nsupply chain standards or concerns over \nproject financing activities. Stakeholders \nand whistleblowers can report violations to the Ethics Hotline using a 24-hour \nphone line, email address, fax line, \nwebsite or physical mailing address.\nIn addition, for certain qualifying proj -\nects, we apply the Equator Principles to \nassess and manage environmental and \nsocial risks. The EP framework includes \nan assessment of the project sponsor’s \nstakeholder engagement process, as well \nas its operational-level grievance mech -\nanisms for affected communities to raise \nconcerns proactively with the project \ndevelopers.Applying Our Policies \nto Protect Human \nRights and Reduce Risk\nWhen our due diligence processes \nuncover the risk of human rights \nviolations in potential or estab -\nlished client relationships, we inves -\ntigate further and, when necessary, \nengage with our clients to better \nunderstand their approach to \nmanaging such risks. When needed, \nwe work with them to identify \ncorrective action in alignment with international best practices. \nIf proactive management of \nhuman rights risks is not possible, \nwe might re-evaluate the client relationship or deny financing or \ninvolvement in a particular transac -\ntion. During 2019, we exited a rela -\ntionship with a client in the palm \noil industry who failed to follow \nour policy requirement of main -\ntaining certification through the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm \nOil (RSPO) — a multistakeholder initiative with principles and criteria \nregarding sustainable palm oil. \n68\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nEmployee Training\nHuman rights content is integrated into \nthe training we provide for the employees \nresponsible for implementing our ESRM \nPolicy and in our Code of Conduct train -\ning, which is required of all employees. During 2019, we developed a comprehen -\nsive module on modern slavery, which so far has been provided to more than 1,000 \nsupply chain employees globally. As we \ncontinue to roll out training, we will iden -\ntify staff across the company whose work \nwould be enhanced through this training.  What’s Ahead\nThe robust policies and programs we have in place throughout our business help us \navoid or effectively address a range of human rights impacts. We are also continu -\nally engaging stakeholders and surveying the global landscape to identify emerg -\ning human rights risks that might affect our business and our stakeholders. For \ninstance, the use of artificial intelligence to boost surveillance and restrict freedom \nof movement in some parts of the world is a growing human rights threat. In \naddition, our conversations about climate change with clients, peers and industry \norganizations increasingly include concerns about the impact of a warming planet \non human rights. We will continue to monitor these issues and other emerging \ntrends to protect our stakeholders and use our influence to uphold human rights \nglobally.  \n69\nResource Use and \nEnvironmental Impacts\nWe have been measuring our environ -\nmental footprint for 20 years and began \nreporting on our direct operational \nimpacts in 2002. During 2019, we \nexplored new avenues for sourcing \nrenewable electricity for our facilities \n1 For performance against our Sustainable Progress Strategy Scorecard, please see the report Appendices .Capitalizing on the tremendous opportunity we have \nfor positive impact through our global operations, we have established commitments\n1 to further minimize the \nenvironmental footprints of our facilities and to ensure high environmental and social standards throughout our \nsupply chain.

Also, in recognition of \nthe connection between environmental \nsustainability and employee well-being, \nwe continued implementing improve -\nments in our workspaces and encourag -\ning employee wellness initiatives.\n2020 Goals\nWe are currently tracking progress against our third generation of opera -\ntional footprint goals — our 2020 goals, which we first announced in 2015. These \ngoals cover energy use, water consump -\ntion, recycling, waste and green building, and, in 2017, we announced a goal to \nuse 100 percent renewable electricity to \npower our facilities globally by 2020. In \n2018, we achieved three of these goals two years early, and during 2019 we made \nprogress in all the areas we measure. We \ncontinue to work toward achievement \nof all six goals and are on track to reach \nat least five of them by the end of 2020, \nas expected. While our strong focus on \nwater has enabled us to surpass our \n2020 goal for total water use reduction, \nour goal to use reclaimed or recycled water for at least 10 percent of our water \nconsumption has proven more challeng -\ning. We are continuing to push forward in this area and identify more places where \nthe use of reclaimed or recycled water is \na viable option.   \nIn 2019, we continued to make progress \nagainst our goal to source 100 percent \nrenewable electricity across Citi’s global \noperations. We own or lease more than \n50 million square feet of real estate across 7,700 properties in 95 countries. \nIt is complex to secure renewable \nelectricity in many of these markets, \nespecially where renewable electricity \nresources are less developed, where we \nhave a smaller presence or where we do \nnot directly source electricity for our operations. In order to meet our ambi -\ntious goal, we have established power purchase agreements (PPAs) in Mexico \nand the U.S.; secured utility green supply \ncontracts in the U.S. and the UK and other parts of Europe; and are obtaining \nenergy attribute certificates in the form \nof renewable energy certificates (RECs), \ninternational RECs, and guarantees of \norigin that support voluntary renewable \nelectricity markets across each of our \noperating regions. We also use on-site \npower when feasible, though it makes up \na small portion of our overall renewable portfolio. We have already completed \nthe work necessary to power our North \nAmerica facilities with renewable elec -\ntricity beginning in 2020. During 2019, we made progress across our Asia Pacific \nand Europe, Middle East and Africa \n(EMEA) regions as well, so we will be able to meet our goal of sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity for all our facilities \nby the end of 2020. In connection with \nour renewable electricity commitment, \nCiti is a member of RE100 — a global \ninitiative led by the Climate Group and \nCDP, which are both part of the We Mean \nBusiness coalition.\nDetailed data showing progress toward \nall of our 2020 goals are included at the \nend of this section. Our greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions and environmental data are verified and assured by SGS, a leading \nthird-party inspection, verification, \ntesting and certification company.

As part of our \nenergy reduction efforts for our facilities \nin North America, we are retrofitting our \nbranches, offices and operations centers \nwith LED lighting. As of the end of 2019, \n9.4 million square feet, representing  89 percent of the square footage of \nour offices and operations centers, had \nbeen retrofitted. We have also completed \nlighting retrofits at 378 banking branches \nwith an additional 144 to be completed \nin 2020. We expect this retrofit, once \ncomplete in 2020, to reduce our energy \nconsumption related to lighting by up \nto 50 percent. Switching to LED lighting also helps improve the overall quality of \nlighting and reduces maintenance costs.The renovation of our global headquar -\nters in New York, for which we were \nawarded LEED Platinum certification, is on track to be completed in 2020. During \nconstruction, approximately 98 percent \nof all concrete, steel and glass demolition \nmaterial was transported to recycling \nfacilities, where it was converted back \ninto new building products. With this \nrenovation, we are installing water- \nconserving plumbing fixtures, enhancing \nthe green space outside the building and implementing systems to improve indoor \nair quality. Water retention tanks on \nthe building’s roof will capture 2 million \ngallons of rainwater annually, which we \nwill use to irrigate plants on the build -\ning’s plaza and terraces. In addition, our cogeneration plant, fueled by natural gas, \nwill produce heat and electricity on-site, \nreducing the building’s carbon footprint by 34 percent. This significant, multiyear \nundertaking has been a driving force in \nsolidifying our approach to sustainable \nbuilding principles and a catalyst for the Citi Hong Kong  \nSustainability  \nInitiatives and Recognition\nDuring 2019, we established \nan agreement with CLP Power \nHong Kong Limited and The \nHongkong Electric Company, \nLimited, to purchase renewable \nenergy certificates equating to a \ncombined 300,000 kilowatt hours \n(kWh) of renewable electricity \nfrom local sources, including \nsolar and wind power. To further reduce our environmental impact \nwe are considering the installa -\ntion of solar panels on the rooftop of Citi Tower in Hong Kong. These \nefforts will help us reach our \n2020 goal to power our facilities \nwith 100 percent renewable \nelectricity.\nOur Citi Tower facility in Hong \nKong also participated in the \n2019 Carbon Challenge orga -\nnized by Dow and the U.S. Green Building Council. Carbon reduc -\ntion initiatives included an energy \naudit, centralized temperature \ncontrol, and automated shutdown \nof air conditioning and lighting \nduring hours when people are \nnot typically in the building. \nThese efforts reduced energy \nconsumption by more than 2,100 \nmetric tons (mt) of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO\n2e) during the \none-year challenge. Our sustain -\nability efforts in Hong Kong were recognized with awards from a \nnumber of organizations during \n2019, including China Light & \nPower, the International Facility \nManagement Association and the \nWorld Green Organisation.  \nIn 2019, we opened a new operations facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for which we achieved LEED \nGold certification.\n73\nimplementation of efficiency projects \nthroughout the global footprint of our \nfacilities. \nThese sustainable building efforts,  \namong others, support our goal to have \n33 percent of our real estate portfolio  \nLEED-certified by the end of 2020. \nEfficient Travel Options\nWe encourage employees to use video \nand web conferencing technologies \nrather than traveling, whenever possible. \nWhen business travel is unavoidable, we \nask employees to group trips together to \nmanage costs and reduce the number of \ntrips taken, and we offer employees the \noption of train travel whenever feasible. \nMany of our offices are centrally located \nnear public transportation, which reduces the need for employees to drive to work. \nTo encourage the use of these options \nand reduce the impact of employee \ncommuting, we offer U.S.-based employ -\nees pre-tax dollars to cover the cost of commuting by subway, bus, train, ferry \nand vanpool. We also offer bike storage \nand bike racks at a number of facilities \nand sponsor bike share programs, known as Citi Bike\n® Program , in New York City, \nJersey City and Miami. At our car park in \nthe London Citigroup Center, we offer a \ndozen charging stations for those driving \nelectric vehicles. Business travel and \nemployee commuting are reported as \npart of our Scope 3 emissions data .\nTransparent Reporting \nof Operational Climate \nImpacts\nCiti reports our Scope 1, Scope 2 and \nScope 3 GHG emissions in both this \nannual Environmental, Social and \nGovernance Report and in our CDP \nresponse. We began reporting on the \ndirect environmental impacts of our oper -\nations in 2002 and have submitted data to CDP every year since 2003. We follow \nthe GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance for measuring and reporting both market-based and \nlocation-based Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG \nemissions. We also report Scope 3 CO\n2 \nemissions from employee air and train travel and project-financed thermal \npower plants in this Environmental, Social \nand Governance Report, and we report Scope 3 electricity transmission loss \nand employee commuting data to CDP. \nIn early 2020, Citi received a score of A \nfrom CDP on our climate change disclo -\nsure and an A- for supply chain reporting, \nfor 2018 data.Employees in Colombia Champion Sustainable Transportation \nIn 2016, Citi employees in Bogotá, Colombia, launched the Citi Mobility program, which \nfocuses on transportation solutions that benefit the environment, the company and the \ncity. The program provides the bank’s employees with rapid, safe and convenient ways \nto get to and from work. As of the end of 2019, it has led to more than 46,000 carpool-\ning trips; more than 7,300 trips by bicycle; and more than 3,900 commutes by walking. \nEfforts like these earned the program first place in the 2019 Sustainability Challenge \nsponsored by Try My Ride, a company committed to promoting sustainability mobility. \nThe Citi Mobility program was judged to have done the most to reduce CO2 emissions, \nimprove quality of life for employees and promote sustainable mobility during the one-\nmonth challenge. Citi Colombia was also awarded a Gold Quality Seal by Bogotá’s Secre-\ntary of Mobility in recognition of the high-quality, secure bicycle parking at the facility. \n74\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nBecause Citi operates in nearly 100 coun -\ntries, our facilities could be exposed to a \nrange of risks that vary in type based on the location of each facility. To increase our resiliency, we have invested in climate adaptation solutions in a number of critical facilities. In addition, our crisis manage -\nment team has developed action plans to address immediate risks and support our employees and customers before, during and after adverse events. Our business continuity team also has plans in place to help Citi resume business operations as quickly as possible in the aftermath of an extreme climate event. We are assessing the exposure of our global facilities to different climate hazards and how that might change over time due to climate change. Moving forward, we also plan to incorporate phys -\nical risks related to climate change into the scenario analyses we conduct on our operations.\nTo avoid the most severe negative impacts \nof climate change, it is estimated we must limit global warming to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, an achieve -\nment that many climate experts suggest is unlikely at this stage. To address the seriousness and urgency of the challenge ahead, Citi has established a goal to transition to sourcing 100 percent renew -\nable power for our facilities by 2020. In addition, we have disclosed our emissions \nfor almost two decades and set significant reduction targets for our energy consump -\ntion. Disclosure of Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions is a component of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our disclosures can be found in our Environmental Impact Report at the end of this section. In 2018, Citi published \nFinance \nfor a Climate-Resilient Future  — a detailed \nreport of our activities and progress in accordance with the TCFD recommendations and metrics. We’ve also included a TCFD index  in this report.\nSustainable design was a priority throughout \nthe renovation of our global headquarters in New York City. \nThe effects of climate change, particularly any associated extreme \nweather events, pose a potential risk to our operations. In addition to mitigating our risks by reducing GHG emissions through the use \nof renewable energy and improved energy efficiency, our Citi Realty \nServices group and crisis management and business continuity teams help us to monitor, prepare for and respond to a range of issues —  \nincluding extreme weather events — that could disrupt our operations. Managing Climate Risk  \nin Our Operations\n75\nEnvironmental  \nSustainability and \nEmployee Well-Being\nWe encourage employees to participate \nin activities and initiatives that emphasize \nthe intersection of personal well-being \nand reduced environmental impact. For \ninstance, our Drink-Up initiative promotes \nhydration, but rather than stocking our \nbreakrooms with disposable plastic water \nbottles, we are converting the water \nfountains at our facilities to also work \nas bottle-filling stations. Based on the amount of water dispensed via the bottle \nfillers, we estimate that we have helped \nemployees avoid the use of nearly  \n3.2 million water bottles in the U.S. and \nclose to 3.8 million in Mexico between  \nthe program’s inception in 2016 and the \nend of 2019.\nTo further inspire well-being at work, our \nannual Step Up challenge encourages employees to use the stairs and walking \npaths at our buildings to increase daily \nphysical activity and improve their \nhealth. Participating employees track the \nnumber of steps they take during walking breaks at work. This initiative has gained \npopularity over the last few years, and \nin 2019 we developed a smartphone app \nto make it even easier for employees to \nparticipate and track progress. During \n2019, 1,300 employees logged more than \n120 million steps.  \nIn addition, we recognize that wellness \nis an important aspect of sustainability \nin building design alongside more tradi -\ntional environmental considerations, such as energy and water efficiency and \nthe use of green materials. When looking \nat how our buildings can affect the \nwell-being of our employees, we consider \nair and water quality, opportunities to \nstay active, healthy food options and a work environment that is both flexible \nand effective. As a result of these efforts, we’ve received WELL Silver certification \nfrom the International WELL Building \nInstitute™ for facilities in Hong Kong \nand India over the last few years. The \nWELL Building Standard is a system for \nmeasuring, certifying and monitoring building features that impact the health \nand well-being of occupants. \nEmployee Engagement\nWe engage employees in achieving our \nenvironmental sustainability objectives in \ntheir day-to-day activities and responsi -\nbilities at work, as well as through volun -\nteer efforts and Green Team activities.\nGreen Teams are employee-led groups \nthat design and lead environmental \ninitiatives — such as recycling drives, \nvolunteer projects, informative lectures \nand awareness campaigns — tailored \nto their workplaces and local commu -\nnities. We have 18 Green Teams, with \n2,670 employees, operating around the \nMembers of the Costa Rica Green Team celebrating the Ecological Blue \nFlag awardGreen Team members participating in a volunteer event  \nin Jacksonville, Florida\n76\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nworld. In 2019, these Green Teams held \n223 volunteer and educational events, \nresulting in 16,200 volunteer hours \ndedicated to helping communities. In \n2019, two of our Green Teams received \nrecognition for their sustainability \nefforts. In Jacksonville, Florida, the local \nGreen Team received the Jacksonville \nEnvironmental Protection Board’s \nEnvironmental Achievement Award in the large business category. Costa Rica’s \nGreen Team received an Ecological \nBlue Flag award, which recognizes local \nefforts that promote conservation and \ndevelopment. In addition, in recognition \nof Earth Day, Citi Green Teams and other \ncolleagues organized environmental and \nsustainability events during the month  \nof April.\nEach year, our company participates in \nthe World Wildlife Fund’s Earth Hour . \nIn March 2019, nearly 2,800 facilities \nin 98 countries turned off the lights \nbetween 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m., local \ntime. Citi has participated in this event \nfor 12 consecutive years.\nResponsible Sourcing\nCiti seeks out suppliers that share our values and our commitment to having \na positive impact in the communities \nwhere we operate. We set high standards \nof performance for resource use and \nsupplier practices across our global \nsupply chain.  \nCiti’s Supply Chain Development, \nInclusion and Sustainability team works \nwith procurement leaders across the \ncompany to support diversity in supplier \nselection, build the capacity of diverse \nsuppliers, implement sustainable supplier \ninitiatives and mitigate environmental and social risks in our supply chain. The \nteam champions inclusive and sustainable \nprocesses and practices as they engage \nwith Citi employees responsible for the \nsupplier selection process. This includes a \nfocus on engagement with women-owned \nbusinesses in developing countries, \nincreased due diligence related to human rights, including issues of modern slavery, \nand further integration of environmental \nsustainability priorities into business \npolicies. \nIn 2015, Citi identified three focus areas \nas part of our Sustainable Progress \nStrategy: paper and paper products, information technology hardware and \ne-waste disposal, and travel and logistics. \nWe have developed position statements \nthat recommend actions for each of \nthese areas and incorporated them \ninto our supply chain Global Operating \nProcedures. In 2019, we continued engag -\ning employees and making progress in these areas, including: \n •Performing an analysis of our printers\n •Communicating the benefits of pur -\nchasing EPEAT-certified products to \nemployees who purchase items for \ntheir teams\n •Reinforcing the importance of sustainable practices in contractual \nlanguage for our technology hard -\nware suppliers that align with EPEAT  \nSupplier Policies\nWe have developed standards and poli -\ncies to support our efforts and clearly communicate our expectations to suppli -\ners regarding environmental and social issues, including the following:\n •The Citi Statement of Supplier \nPrinciples  outlines the aspirational \nguidelines that anchor our sustain -\nable supply chain initiative, including \nthose related to ethical business \npractices, human rights in the \nworkplace, environmental sustain -\nability, management systems and implementation.\n •The Citi Requirements for Suppliers , \nformerly known as Citi Standards for Suppliers, facilitates supplier compli -\nance with contractual requirements and other key Citi policy obligations.\n •Suppliers are also asked to abide by \nthe Citi Statement on Human Rights . For more information about our approach to human rights, see the \nHuman Rights section .\nIn addition, Citi complies with the UK \nModern Slavery Act and releases an \nannual transparency statement summa -\nrizing our approach to identifying and \nmitigating the risks of modern slavery in \nour operations and supply chain.\nSupplier Engagement  \nand Evaluation\nWe use a Corporate Responsibility \nQuestionnaire (CRQ) to evaluate \nsuppliers’ adherence to our Statement \nof Supplier Principles. The CRQ helps \nus gauge how well suppliers manage a \nrange of issues, such as environmental \nmanagement, human rights, labor prac -\ntices, diversity, and health and safety. For example, the CRQ for our EMEA \nregion includes specific questions to help identify and contribute to eradicating \nchild labor and modern slavery, including \nforced or bonded labor and human \ntrafficking. We plan to implement these \nquestions across other regions in coming \nyears.\nIntegrating these important issues into \nour CRQ and our broader work to address \nthe issue of modern slavery is part of \nthe way Citi supports SDG 8 , which aims \nto promote sustained, inclusive and \nsustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent \nwork for all . In particular, our work in this \narea addresses target 8.7 , which includes \na mandate to eradicate forced labor, end \nmodern slavery and human trafficking \nand end child labor in all its forms.\nSDG G oal 8: Decent Work and Economic \nGrowth\nGiven our global footprint, we rely on \na strong network of Global Champions \n— Citi colleagues around the world who \nserve as connections between their busi -\nnesses and supply chain sustainability \nand diversity efforts — to help implement \n77\n2019 CRQ Implementation\n87%    12 %\nNorth America\n100 %    33 %\nEurope, Middle East \nand Africa\nN/A     N/A\nLatin America*100 %    21 %\nAsia PacificCRQ Surveys \nCompleted\nSuppliers Scoring \n70% or Lower\n14 languages\nin which the CRQ is available\n• Arabic\n• English\n• French\n• German\n• Hungarian\n• Italian\n• Japanese\n• Korean\n• Portuguese• Russian\n• Spanish\n• Turkish\n•  Simplified \nChinese \n(China)\n•  Traditional \nChinese (Taiwan)sustainable supplier initiatives locally \nand adapt the CRQ to local cultures and \nbusiness norms. We also translate the \nCRQ into 14 languages to make it easier \nfor suppliers to complete and to enable productive follow-up conversations.\nOur goal is for suppliers to complete the \nCRQ every two years. If a supplier’s CRQ \nscore is below 70 percent, we communi -\ncate our concerns and ask the supplier to take action to improve and submit a new \nCRQ the following year. We have rolled \nout the CRQ to more than 30 percent of \nour suppliers and are focusing on imple -\nmentation with our top 100 suppliers \nbased on spend. In 2019, 16 percent of \nour top 100 suppliers scored 70 percent \nor lower on the CRQ. We meet with \nsuppliers that fall below the 70 percent \nthreshold and outline steps together to \nimprove these scores within the year \nwhen they resubmit.  Additional training \nand face-to-face dialogue has proven to help suppliers quickly address any issues \nflagged related to their CRQ responses \nand align to Citi’s expectations. If the \nnecessary improvement is not achieved \nwithin that year, we escalate review to determine whether the contract should \nbe discontinued. In addition, to ensure \na consistent approach and understand -\ning of the CRQ process and supplier evaluation, we provide training for our \nemployees. We also provide sustainability \ntraining and education to suppliers.\nSupplier Diversity \nOur Supply Chain Development, Inclusion and Sustainability team sets clear \nsupplier diversity goals and embeds them \nin our supplier selection processes. In \naddition, we provide U.S. small businesses \nand women-, veteran-, disability-, LGBT+- \nand minority-owned firms with access \nto business opportunities, education, \nmentoring and training. Working with a \nrange of supplier-focused organizations, we identify diverse suppliers, including \nsmall businesses that can meet our \nsupply chain needs, help build these \nsuppliers’ capacities and support supply \nchain diversity and inclusion more \nbroadly. These organizations include the \nNational Minority Supplier Development Council and several of its global affili -\nates, the Women’s Business Enterprise Council, the National LGBT Chamber of \nCommerce and WEConnect International. \nWe also engage with UN Women and \nthe Sustainable Purchasing Leadership \nCouncil, an organization dedicated to \nsustainable purchasing efforts. \nFor every bid over $250,000, we require \nthe inclusion of diverse suppliers in \nthe bidding process. This requirement \nensures that diverse suppliers are consid -\nered not only for small engagements but for large ones as well. As the result of a \ntechnology upgrade that began in 2018 \nand continued into 2019, our enterprise \nsupply chain employees were provided \nAmong Top 100 Suppliers\n* During 2019, none of our suppliers in Latin America were within the top 100 by spend. \n78\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \naccess to enriched supplier diversity data \nand analytics, enabling them to consider \nadditional certified diverse suppliers they \nmight not otherwise have visibility to. The \ntechnology also provided data to support \nmeasurable, sustainable goals to further \nadvance our diversity efforts.\nCiti is committed to procuring from \nwomen-owned businesses, especially \nfrom firms located in developing markets. \nIn 2019, we worked with partner organi -\nzations to identify businesses around the \nworld that have registered as women-\nowned through these organizations \nand evaluate their capabilities. We also \nworked to identify existing women-owned \nCiti suppliers and encourage those not \nalready members of WEConnect to join \nin order to be more easily identified by \ncompanies seeking their services. In 2019, \nwe procured $149 million from women-owned businesses.\nOur efforts to support women-owned \nbusinesses align with SDG 5: Achieve \ngender equality and empower all women \nand girls. In particular, our work in this \narea helps address target 5.5 , which aims \nto ensure women’s full and effective \nparticipation and equal opportunities \nfor leadership at all levels of deci -\nsion-making in political, economic and public life.\nSDG Goal 5:  Gender Equality\nEngaging Diverse Broker-Dealers\nCiti has a history of consistently working with diverse broker-dealers, and we have \nused an underwriting syndicate composed of diverse third-party broker-dealers — \nincluding those that are minority-, veteran- and women-owned — for more than 15 \nyears. Since 2015, we have used exclusively minority- and women-owned businesses \nas co-managers on at least one transaction each year.\nIn 2019, we included at least seven diverse broker-dealers in each of our 12 USD, \nunsecured benchmark debt and capital offerings — using 30 different diverse firms \nthroughout the year. We also hosted our 15th annual broker-dealer breakfast, which \nprovides diverse broker-dealers with an opportunity to share best practices and  \nnetwork with Citi leaders.\n$1.18 B\nTotal amount spent \non Tier 1 and Tier 2 \ndiverse suppliers in \n2019 \n($700 million direct  \nspend on Tier 1 only)\n79\nPaving the Way for Diverse Banks\nActing on Treasury’s commitment to \nachieve a more inclusive network of finan -\ncial agents, and our own commitment to increase supplier diversity, we worked with Treasury to engage with the Washington D.C.-based, Black-owned Industrial Bank as the program’s first certified protégé. Industrial Bank was founded in the 1930s and has since grown to become one of the largest minority-owned banks in the U.S., with assets of more than $432 million.For the past decade, Citi has been respon -\nsible for the day-to-day management of the Bureau’s OTCnet application, which auto -\nmates its point-of-sale/over-the-counter check-deposit process by capturing check images. OTCnet processes $100 billion of deposits annually. By jointly developing our proposal for the re-bid of the OTCnet program with Industrial Bank, the firm will be able to become a full OTCnet partner. Industrial will also participate in knowledge-  \nsharing sessions with Citi aimed at transferring our institutional expertise and experience to enrich Industrial Bank’s qualifications. This work will put Industrial Bank on a path to become a financial agent in the future and enable it to bid for federal contracts on its own.\nCiti is one of a handful of large national banks authorized to work as \nfinancial agents for the U.S. Department of the Treasury. This allows us to perform financial services on behalf of Treasury and its financial \nmanagement arm, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Through the Bureau’s \nFinancial Agent Mentor-Protégé Program, financial agents such as Citi are paired with small banks — including minority- and women-owned banks — to pave the way for more firms in the minority-owned  \nbanking sector to perform important financial services for Treasury. \n80\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nBuilding the Capacity of Diverse \nSuppliers\nOutreach programs that engage, educate, \ndevelop and train our diverse suppliers \nand partners are integral to the efforts \nof our team. One of our priorities is \nto ensure that small and diverse busi -\nnesses have the training they need to compete with more established firms. \nFor instance, we help build capacity in \nthe area of sustainability so that a lack of \nknowledge in that area doesn’t become a roadblock to completing our CRQ or \nother requirements for working with Citi. \nDuring 2019, we collaborated with the \nNew York & New Jersey Minority Supplier \nDevelopment Council to host the ninth \nannual Sustainability Symposium in New \nYork City. The agenda included a focus \non the integration of the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals into standard business practices, a workshop with the \nUN Global Compact to educate diverse \nfirms about the business implications of \nmodern slavery as well as a panel focused \non ratings and reporting.\nTo further build the capacity of diverse \nsuppliers, we host events in different \nlocations around the world to share \ninformation and best practices for \ndoing business with Citi and other large \ncompanies. We often include “match -\nmaking sessions” during these events, \nto help connect suppliers with buyers \nand regional sourcing managers. During \n2019, our EMEA team partnered with \nWEConnect International and Minority \nSupplier Development UK to host several \nof these events throughout the region, \nincluding in Hungary, Kenya and South \nAfrica. We also worked with WEConnect to host events in Brazil, Costa Rica and \nMexico.  In 2019, we continued our participation \nin an in-depth mentoring and training program called AC2A, in partnership \nwith the New York & New Jersey Minority \nSupplier Development Council, Rutgers \nUniversity, Covenant Business Concepts \nand other corporate sponsors. Through \nthis program, Citi works with diverse \nsuppliers and other corporate coaches to \nensure that diverse suppliers have access \nto information through workshops about sustainability, leadership development \nand coaching. This is the fifth year Citi \nhas participated in the program. Also in \n2019, in partnership with the Minority \nSupplier Development UK (MSDUK) \nprogram, we provided a scholarship \nfor a finalist of the MSDUK Innovation \nChallenge — a pitch competition for \nminority-owned businesses. What’s Ahead \nWe have been measuring our operational environmental impacts for two decades \nand, over time, it’s become increasingly \nclear that incremental improvements \nin this area are table stakes.

Across our company, we \nempower our employees to develop and \ndeliver new solutions that meet the most \npressing needs of our clients, customers \nand communities. Working in partnership \nwith startups, governments, universities and technology companies, our Citi \nVentures team is one of the key ways \nwe drive innovative change for financial To achieve the breakthrough innovations that are critical \nto business success, Citi must do more than stay current with today’s technological advancements; we must also \nexamine the trends and issues that are changing the \nworld around us and affecting the needs of our clients  \nand customers. We recognize innovation/digitization as a material environmental, social and governance (ESG) \nissue . It also connects to and enables several of our other \nmaterial issues, including financial inclusion, data security \nand privacy, customer satisfaction, and products with environmental and social benefits. A decade of innovation\nCiti Innovation Labs have been creating \nand scaling new ideas since 2009\nPage 87Protecting digital identity\nWe focus on employee training, investigation of new \ntechnology and broad engagement on the issue\nPage 95HIGHLIGHTS\n86\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nservices. Since 2010, Citi Ventures has \ninvested in  more than 40  startups and \nhas helped to pilot or  commercialize  more \nthan 60 percent  of those startups within \nCiti. The team’s current portfolio includes \ncompanies that are leading the way in \ninvestment platforms, digital infrastruc -\nture, fintech, commerce and payments. \nIn addition to investing in startups, Citi \nVentures advances innovation through \nthree complementary focus areas.\n •Through our D10X® program, we \nempower our employees to build, test \nand launch new solutions that are \nexponentially better for our clients. \nThis approach helps us accelerate \nlearning and bring more certainty to \nwhere we should — or should not — \ninvest resources. \n •Our Emerging Technology team monitors new solutions that offer the \ngreatest potential to transform the \nlives of people, businesses and com -\nmunities. Working closely with Citi colleagues and the external innova -\ntion ecosystem, we learn, engage and \nexperiment.  This is critical as we look \nto upskill our workforce and prepare both our employees and our clients \nfor the next decade.\n •Our Studio  team, which launched \nin 2018, collaborates with Citi colleagues internally and engages \nwith the broader, external digital \ninnovation ecosystem to understand \nthe macro trends affecting economic \nvitality for people, businesses and \ncities and to incubate solutions. The \nteam identifies areas where Citi can \ndrive change and help communities thrive, specifically looking at the \nfuture of work, inclusive entrepre -\nneurship and city competitiveness. \nThrough these efforts and others across Citi, we collaborate on breakthrough \nideas that originate outside of our \ncompany and support innovation from Citi Innovation Labs: A Decade of Innovation\nUnderstanding the needs and expectations of our customers in relation to technology is a longstanding tradition for Citi. In 1975, the rise in popularity of \nATMs prompted us to establish a research center exploring consumer behavior \nand interactions with these machines. From there, our interest in how technol -\nogy both influences customer expectations and has a positive impact on their experiences with our bank has only grown. \nIn 2009, we opened our first Citi Innovation Lab in Dublin, Ireland, with the \naim of understanding how advancements in technology would impact our \nclients’ expectations as well as our business models and treasury operations. \nIn the decade since, our Innovation Lab model has evolved to keep pace with \ntechnological advancements, the direction of our business and the needs of \nour clients. We started with a single lab that operated independently from our \nbusiness and was focused on Citi-oriented solutions. Today our Innovation \nLab network has grown to five labs globally. Not only are these labs now more integrated with our core business — enabling greater innovation throughout \nour organization — they also partner with fintech firms to bring new solutions \nto scale from concept through execution. \nIn the last 10 years, technological innovation has led to new ways of doing \nbusiness as well as completely new business models based on e-commerce, \nconnected systems and real-time dynamics. The two-way channel between \nour labs and our business enables collaboration and a free exchange of ideas, \nhelping us find cutting-edge solutions and often co-creating with our clients to \naddress the unique challenges they face. \nAs we move forward, our Labs are considering how business models will \nchange in the coming years as demographics shift, the needs and activities \nof our clients evolve and technology continues to develop at a rapid pace. \nCiti currently has Innovation Labs in England, Ireland, Israel, Mexico and \nSingapore.\n87\nwithin — thereby incubating new solutions \nand products that support our mission of \ngrowth and economic progress. \nEmpowering Financial \nSecurity and Strengthening \nCommunities \nIn 2019, Citi Ventures invested in, built \nand launched a range of products and \nservices that improve financial security \nfor consumers and support community \ndevelopment. One such investment is \nDigit  — an app that analyzes users’ spend -\ning habits and helps them save money. Digit connects to an individual’s checking \naccount and uses advanced algorithms \nthat look at historical transaction behav -\nior and use predictive technology to \ndetermine the optimal amount of money \nto save each day. It then automatically \nmoves that money into a separate \naccount. This automation helps users \nbetter understand their financial health \nand save money without thinking about \nit so they can reach their goals and feel \nmore financially secure. The Citi Ventures team partnered with Digit in 2019 to help \nthem build their business and scale their \nsolutions. \nSimilarly, Citi Venture’s D10X program \nsupported an internal team of employees \nto develop a solution that helps consum -\ners track their spending and manage their finances. This app — called Beacon \nby Citi — tracks everyday expenses such \nas eating out, buying coffee, taking taxis \nor buying groceries and then provides customized activities based on each \nperson’s spending habits to encourage \nbehavior change. Both Digit and Beacon \nby Citi are available to everyone via the \nApp Store and Google Play, regardless of \nwhether they are Citi customers. \nIn addition to tools that help individuals \nmanage their personal finances, we also \ncontribute to solutions that support the \nfinancial health of entire communities. In \n2019, we launched City Builder by Citi\nSM, \na data-driven platform for investors and \nfunds to explore place-based investments, \nAccelerating the  \nIdentification of Assets  \nfor Green Bonds\nGreen bonds are debt instruments whose proceeds \ngo toward financing or refinancing projects that meet certain environmental or climate-aligned criteria. \nOne challenge of green bonds is that they require \ncompanies to identify new projects or green assets on their balance sheets for the bonds to fund. This is often a slow, manual process, which can discourage large \ncompanies from attempting to secure green bonds.  \nIn 2019, one of our employee-led D10X \nteams developed and piloted a new plat -\nform in partnership with Microsoft that uses machine learning to automate this time-intensive process — rapidly scanning balance sheet data to identify potential green assets and suggesting financing or refinancing structures. This cloud-based service also has the potential to help institutional investors and asset managers track their green bond investments, learn more about their portfolio and provide impact reporting. After successful internal tests, Citi is exploring piloting the service with public-sector clients, including develop -\nment banks. We will use insights from  \nthe pilot to refine and improve the plat -\nform, with the goal of making green bonds a more accessible option for companies  \nand large issuers with extensive or complex balance sheets.  \n88\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nidentify local investment needs and gain \nvaluable insights into the potential social \nimpact of investments in affordable \nhousing, job creation, youth services and \nmore. City Builder by Citi is currently \nfocused on supporting community impact \ninvestments in U.S. Opportunity Zones, \naggregating census data and real estate \ninsights to present a comprehensive view \nof the needs and opportunities within \neach city.  \nInvesting in Tech Talent\nIn addition to supporting entrepreneurs and innovative companies, we also invest \nin the passionate, skilled employees \nwithin Citi who know our business, \nknow our clients and have their own \ngroundbreaking ideas that can benefit \ncustomers. And we look to attract future \ntech talent by developing meaningful \nprograms that pave the way for the next \ngeneration of leaders. Our D10X program, powered by Citi Ventures, is one way we foster innovation \ninternally and encourage new ideas \nacross our businesses. Through this \nmodel, we engage our employees and \npartner with our clients to develop, vali -\ndate, test and deploy innovations quickly and effectively. Employees test their hypotheses and refine their approaches \nthrough direct contact with clients. \nGrounded in the principles of venture \ncapital and in Lean Startup methodology, \nparticipating employees are coached \nand championed by seasoned, in-house \ncoaches through each step of the process \n— from ideation to pitching and validating \nideas to launching solutions into the market. Examples of projects in devel -\nopment during 2019 include the Beacon by Citi app and cloud-based green assets \nas a service platform, both mentioned \nearlier. Since the program’s inception in \n2016, more than 2,800 employees have \nbeen involved with D10X, and we have \ntested nearly 300 new ideas.Another important part of our innovation \nstrategy involves engaging with diverse \nemerging talent. Through Citi® University \nPartnerships in Innovation & Discovery \n(CUPID), launched in 2018, Citi embeds \nstudents from leading universities in \ninnovation activities across the company. \nThe students gain exposure to various \naspects of Citi’s businesses while helping \nto solve complex, real-world challenges \nwith cutting-edge solutions for clients \nand communities. \nCUPID emphasizes an interdisciplin -\nary, collaborative approach, seeking \nout talent beyond business graduate \nprograms to include individuals studying \ndesign, engineering and public policy. \nRather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we match students in the \nprogram with innovation-focused \ninternships that fit their interests, \ngoals and skills. In 2019, we hosted a \nskills-building summit for students from \nhistorically black colleges and universities \nDiversity in Student and University Participation \nThrough CUPID\nThe Citi® University Partnerships in Innovation & Discovery (CUPID) program collaborates with  \na diverse group of students from more than 70 leading universities to support innovation efforts \nacross Citi.\n1,800\nstudents with whom \nthe CUPID program \nhas engaged20%\nof students engaged \nare from historically \nblack colleges and \nuniversities75%\nof students are not \npursuing Masters in \nBusiness degreesHosted our first  \nALL-WOMEN HACKATHON \nat Wellesley College  \nin 2019\n89\nand initiated a recruitment program \nwith women’s colleges, beginning with \nWellesley College. In addition to engaging \nwith universities in Canada, the UK and \nthe U.S., we expanded the program into \nAsia for the first time with the addition of Singapore Management University. Approximately 1,800 students from more \nthan 70 universities have participated \nsince CUPID was established.

Customer-Centric \nSolutions\nThe success of our business depends on \nbalancing the needs of all our customers. \nThis means that while we maintain our \nphysical branches and analog processes \nfor our customers who depend on them \n— a sizable and important portion of our \ncustomer base — we are also investing in \nand advancing digital solutions, which we \nsee as our biggest opportunity for future \ngrowth. Our Global Consumer Banking business has reshaped itself in recent \nyears to become even more customer- \ncentric, with a focus on digital solutions \nthat meet customers where they are and \nrespond to the ways they want to engage \nwith us. A growing number of customers \nexpect digital innovation that provides \nease and convenience in accessing finan -\ncial information and empowers them to \nmanage their money responsibly. \nEmpowering Customers \nThrough Digital Platforms\nAs more of our customers embrace \nmobile technology, we have evolved to \na mobile-first strategic focus. Some of \nthe most recent updates to our mobile \nbanking app provide practical, convenient \nsolutions that empower customers \nto avoid fraudulent activity on their \naccounts. For instance, customers can \nuse the app to report lost or stolen ATM \nand debit cards and track replacement cards, all while monitoring their transac -\ntion history for fraudulent activity. They can also use the geolocation of their \nmobile phones to gauge their proximity \nto their credit cards during point of sale \ntransactions, which reduces the likelihood \nthat a genuine transaction will be inter -\nrupted due to a mistaken fraud alert. \nSecure, streamlined solutions are also \nimportant for connecting with new \ncustomers and expanding offerings to our \n1 World Economic Forum, The Future of Jobs Report 2018  (Sept. 2018), pages v, vii and 23, http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf . The Future of Jobs Report 2018  from the World Economic Forum offers a \nbroad overview of how the Fourth Industrial Revolution is affecting the global \nworkforce and an analysis of how the labor market will take shape leading up \nto 2022. Among other findings, the report asserts that to meet the future \nneeds of their organizations, businesses must support the reskilling and \nupskilling of their current workforces (beyond just those employees already \nperforming in-demand jobs). Furthermore, the report found that as the \nworkforce changes rapidly, the window to proactively manage this change \nis closing. Unfortunately, rather than embracing this window of opportunity, \nmany employers are focusing their upskilling efforts on a narrow set of already highly skilled, highly valued employees.\n1\nIn this context of a rapidly changing world and a workforce that is transform -\ning along with it, Citi is providing our employees with access to resources \nthat help them build digital skills, enabling them to take advantage of oppor -\ntunities within our company. Through the online platform Degreed, we offer employees learning pathways on digital awareness and digital acumen. These \ncurated collections of resources — including courses, videos, articles and \nother tools — help employees gain an understanding of the digital world and \nprovide insight into the latest technology trends, how they impact Citi and \nwhat our company is doing in response. The resources cover a wide range \nof topics, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, extended reality, and agile and robotic process automation. Employees can \ncomplement this coursework by joining an online collaboration community \nwhere they share knowledge and best practices with their colleagues about \nthe skills required for the future of work. \nIn addition, our Citi Ventures Emerging Technology team engages with stake -\nholders inside and outside of Citi to understand technological breakthroughs \non the horizon. The team uses this knowledge to push Citi’s collective under -\nstanding forward and develops learning packs to educate Citi employees about next-generation technologies, opportunities within the current market \nand how their skills could be used in the future. Building Digital Acumen \n90\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nexisting customers. In 2019, for example, \nwe became the first bank in Poland to \nuse biometrics to make credit card and \nloan application processes more efficient \nfor our customers. The technology \nenables automatic income verification \nand remote confirmation of a client’s \nidentity using facial biometrics. And in \nMexico, Citibanamex customers now \nhave a quick, secure, digital option for opening accounts in branches nationwide. \nIn both cases, these technologies reduce \nwait time for customers, contributing to \npositive customer satisfaction. Further, \nthe increased integration of digital tech -\nnologies in our processes increases the accessibility of our products and services \nfor those unable to visit a branch. \nWe are also developing solutions to serve \nour institutional clients who are embrac -\ning mobile technologies. The CitiDirect \nBE\n® Mobile app is a digital solution for \nour institutional customers that enables \na secure, convenient way to authorize \npayments, view balances and cash \npositions and manage users. Throughout \n2019, we expanded access for clients \nacross many countries in Latin America \nand the Caribbean, enabling the use of \nfingerprint or facial recognition to access \nthe platform. Designed in partnership with clients, these biometric solutions \nenable authentication in mere seconds \nand serve as an alternative method for \nsecure access to their accounts. We \nare introducing the app and biometric \nauthentication capability in additional \nmarkets throughout the region.\nDeveloping Solutions with \nCustomer Feedback \nCiti identifies customer satisfaction as \none of our most material ESG issues . \nWe know that we exist to bring value to all of our stakeholders, including our \ncustomers. Monitoring their feedback \nand addressing concerns is vital to our \nsuccess as we seek to deliver value and \nempower customers with tools that help \nthem thrive financially. To this end, we actively engage with customers, listen to \nconcerns and take direct action based on \nfeedback. \nCiti takes an agile approach t o under -\nstanding the customer experience, \nand we use a range of inputs, including \ncustomer feedback, to prioritize improve -\nments across our businesses. Through the use of customer survey input, quantitative metrics such as product \nuse and Net Promoter Score, and the \nidentification of pain points through \nmultichannel monitoring (including social media, phone, chat and email), we \nare able to take corrective action, drive \nimprovements and prioritize product \nenhancements that are important to our \ncustomers.Fast-Tracking Solutions to Support Financial Well-Being\nLaunched in 2018, the Citi® Open Innovation Challenge was a five-week virtual program \nthat challenged applicants to answer the question: “How can Citi empower customers to \nmanage their debt and improve their overall financial wellness?” During 2019, selected \napplicants participated in the Citi FinTech Integration Program, where they received \nmentorship to develop their ideas on an accelerated path to commercialization with Citi, \nas well as practical tools and lessons they can apply to work with other large organiza-\ntions. The seven fintechs selected to participate represent a wide variety of solutions to \nhelp promote financial wellness, including debt repayment, management of household \nfinances and more. The Future of Digital, \nCustomer-Oriented \nBanking \nDespite rapidly emerging technol -\nogies, legacy banks can be bogged \ndown with siloed data, manual \nprocesses and outdated technology. \nIn order to meet our customers’ \nexpectations, we must reinvent \nbanking, aided by digital solutions \nand with customer experiences and \nexpectations at the center of the \nmodel. Read more about the oppor -\ntunities banks have to embrace \npartnerships and disruptive technol -\nogies to transform themselves into digital competitors in a 2019  \nreport from Citi Global Perspectives  \n& Solutions (Citi GPS) entitled  \nBank X: The New New Banks . \n91\nIn 2019, for example, we tackled the top \ncustomer complaint that we receive at \nCiti branches: wait time. Teams across \nCiti partnered together, tapping into the \nexpertise of employees in Independent \nCompliance Risk Management, Legal, \nFinance, Global Consumer Banking, \nGlobal Public Affairs, Human Resources, \nand Operations and Technology to \nsolve this problem for our customers. The result is our Digital Appointment \nscheduling — a seamless, simple-to-use \ntool that enables branch customers to \nuse Citi Online or the Citi Mobile\n® App \nto schedule visits that are convenient for them. Because the scheduler uses \nreal-time availability pulled from bankers’ \ncalendars, customers can count on \nbranch employees being ready to meet \ntheir needs when they arrive.  Designing for Accessibility\nAs we strive to put all customers at the \ncenter of what we do, we recognize the \nimportance of providing products and \nservices that meet accessibility needs \nand preferences. We offer Braille and \ntalking ATMs, large print and Braille \nstatements and raised-line checks for the \nvisually impaired. We also offer TTY or \nText Telephone for the hearing impaired. \nMany of our services are provided in multiple languages to support the diverse \npopulations we serve, and our products \nare tailored to meet the needs of the \nindividuals in the countries where we do \nbusiness.\nOur global Disability Affinity group \ndeepens employees’ understanding of \nthe appropriate etiquette and language \nto use when interacting with people with \ndisabilities.  During 2019, the Affinity \ncreated an employee user group to help us test our current assistive technologies, \nso we can identify problem areas and \nwork with our external technology part -\nners to develop applications that are fully accessible. \nBeyond individual features, technologies \nand services, when we think about \nthe best way to serve those in the \ndisability community, we also consider \nother factors and issues that intersect \nwith disability and must be overcome to advance financial inclusion and \nempowerment. In 2018, we worked with \nthe National Disability Institute and the \nCity of New York to launch Empowered \nCities — a national initiative to improve \nfinancial access, stability and opportunity \nfor low-income people with disabilities \nand their families. Building on that effort, \nin 2019 we participated in a convening of commissioners from 10 mayoral offices \nand disabilities-focused leaders to explore \nhow we can address the most-pressing \nfinancial security issues facing the \ndisability community. Gatherings like this \nhelp us to expand financial inclusion for \npeople with disabilities, both through #1 in Customer  \nSatisfaction\nIn 2019, the American Customer \nSatisfaction Index rated Citibank \nthe #1 retail bank for customer \nsatisfaction. We led national banks \nin the areas of perceived value, \ncustomer loyalty and retention \nand call center satisfaction, among \nothers. We also earned the top spot \nin Business Insider Intelligence’s \nU.S. Mobile Banking Competitive Edge Study, due to the customer-  \ncentric features available in our mobile app. \n92\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nsupport for financial education as well as \nin the design of truly inclusive products \nand services. \nSafeguarding Data  \nand Protecting Customer Information\nAs digital solutions expand and become \nmore integrated into our daily lives, \nwe see increasing concerns related to \nprivacy and security breaches. Data \nsecurity and privacy are top priorities \nfor Citi and for our stakeholders and are \namong our most material ESG issues.\nInformation Security\nCiti’s Chief Information Security Office \n(CISO) Program combines information \ngathering and data analysis with foren -\nsics to inform strategic decisions. Our approach rests on having the right tech -\nnology, systems, policies, processes and talent in place to prevent, detect, respond \nto and recover from cyber threats quickly. \nOur CISO Program is accredited by the \nBritish Standards Institution, and we are the first major financial institution to \nhave our program ISO 27001 certified. \nThe program is also regularly examined \nby regulators, as well as by internal and \nexternal auditors.\nThe Audit Committee of our Board of \nDirectors oversees the development, \nimplementation and maintenance of our \nCISO Program. The program is managed \nby the Chief Enterprise Infrastructure \nOperations & Technology Officer and the Chief Information Security Officer \non a global enterprise basis; the Chief \nExecutives of each business sector and \nregion are responsible for implementa -\ntion and compliance with program proce -\ndures and requirements. Annually, we \nprovide our employees with training on \nhow to properly handle personal informa -\ntion and how to maintain the security and privacy of information when working with companies that provide services to us.\nTo safeguard information in our own \noperations and for our clients, we invest \nin, develop and use advanced technol -\nogy. For instance, the Citi Virtual Card Account provides a secure, business- \nto-business digital solution for large \nworkflows through the generation of unique, nonplastic account numbers. The \nvirtual card technology enables real-time \ntransactions that are automated and \nsecure, safeguarding against fraud and \npotential misuse. The card eliminates the \nneed for paper-based payments but still \nleaves an electronic trace, which allows \nfor easy reconciliation and reporting. \nDuring 2019, we also announced the Citi Payment Outlier Detection solution. \nThis technology uses analytics, artificial \nintelligence and machine learning to \nfind transactions that don’t align with \ntypical patterns of activity. These outliers \ncan then be investigated to determine \nwhether they indicate fraud. \nCiti conducts regular information secu -\nrity risk assessments and has internal \ncontrols to defend against information \nsecurity breaches. We have stringent poli -\ncies and employ robust technologies to protect our data and systems, supported \nby a strong team with deep expertise. \nOur CISO team protects information from \ndata breaches and misuse by maintaining \nstrong networks to protect our systems \nand databases, but we remain vigilant as \n2     Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions, Managing Cyber Risk with Human Intelligence: A Practical Approach  (May 2019), page 3, https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/managing-\ncyber-risk-with-human-intelligence/ .Managing Cyber \nRisk with Human \nIntelligence\nTechnological advancements \nenrich our lives and empower us \nwith interconnectedness, access \nto information and increased effi -\nciency. Unfortunately, those same positive attributes can be exploited \nby those who carry out cyberat -\ntacks on individuals, corporations and governments. It is estimated \nthat cyber breaches cost the global economy $1.5 trillion per year, and \nthis is expected to increase, with \nsome sources believing it could cost \nthe global economy $6 trillion by \n2021.\n2\nIn a 2019 report entitled Managing \nCyber Risk with Human Intelligence: \nA Practical Approach , Citi Global Perspectives & Solutions (Citi GPS)  \nexplores cyber risk for governments, \ninfrastructure systems, corporations \nand individuals. The report advocates \nfor a move away from reactive, defen -\nsive approaches and toward a proac -\ntive, intelligence-led risk management \nstrategy. It also provides foundational \nguidance for how to move in that direction. \n93\nwe know that such threats persist. Our \nInformation Security Utility team works \nwith partners across Citi’s businesses \nto support CISO Program compliance \nrequirements and increase efficiency \nthrough standardized processes and \nautomation.\nIn the event of a potential breach, we \nhave a robust process to ensure an effec -\ntive response, which includes: \n •Reviewing the breach to determine \nwhether it meets any regulatory \nor legal reporting requirements in \nthe country(ies) where the breach \noccurred or in the country(ies) \nimpacted by the breach. If deemed \nnecessary, a legal assessment is \nconducted.\n •Notifying the impacted customers as required by the laws or regulations \nof the impacted country(ies) and as \ndirected in the legal assessment, if it \nresults in a requirement to perform \ncustomer notifications. We also collaborate with external stake -\nholders to raise the level of security of \nthe industry. Working with our clients, \ncompetitors, governments, law enforce -\nment and intelligence agencies, we share best practices and conduct joint cyber resilience exercises. Our security \nteams also study information security \nchallenges across industries to learn how \nto strengthen our internal practices and \nrespond to problems quickly. \nPrivacy\nThe fair, ethical and lawful collection, use and processing of customers’ personal \ninformation is essential to build trust, \nprovide best-in-class services and achieve \nour corporate objectives. To help meet \nthis goal, Citi has established a dedi -\ncated Chief Privacy Office team led by \na global Chief Privacy Of fic er. The Chief \nPrivacy Office, part of our Independent Compliance Risk Management team, \nmanages the Citi Global Privacy program, \nwhich is overseen by the Citi Global Privacy Committee. The program \nprovides a framework for managing \nprivacy and confidentiality risks for the company.\nCiti’s Privacy and Confidentiality Policy \narticulates principles relating to the \ncollection and processing of personal \ninformation, requiring, in part, that \npersonal information only be collected \nand used as necessary for the perfor -\nmance of the services offered and for the purposes disclosed in a privacy notice. \nCiti is transparent in our collection and \nuse practices and offers customers choices with respect to how their \npersonal information may be collected \nor otherwise used (as required by law), \nincluding opting out of marketing or \nother communications or reviewing and \ncorrecting information. Citi employees \nare required to take privacy and infor -\nmation compliance training that covers these privacy concepts.\n94\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nWhat’s Ahead\nThe depth and reach of digital innovation \noffer us incredible opportunities to \ndeepen relationships with our existing \nclients and customers while expanding \nour business. In the coming years, part -\nnerships will be critical as we collaborate to bring innovations to scale, expand \nfinancial inclusion through digital \nsolutions, strengthen our business and \nrespond to the changing expectations of our clients and customers with agility and \nexpertise. \nAs reliance on digital technologies \naccelerates, it is imperative that we remain knowledgeable of the latest \nadvancements and the related implica -\ntions for our business and our clients and customers, including safeguarding digital \nidentities, the ethical use of artificial \nintelligence and the opportunities offered \nby blockchain, to name a few. Digital \nadvancements affect every aspect of our \nbusiness, so we will continue to engage our employees with resources that help \nthem acquire and hone the skills essential \nto their success at Citi and, by extension, \nour success in the marketplace. \nProtecting Digital Identity\nOur digital identities are a critical aspect of our \nmodern lives and integral to many financial products and services. With this, we face the ongoing threat of \nidentity theft and cyberattacks that can undermine \nthe security of our personal information. As a result, people often wonder how to take full advantage of digital solutions while protecting their privacy and \nsafeguarding their data, especially as they grow weary \nof complex authentication requirements and the need to remember an ever-growing list of passwords and user IDs. \nFor financial institutions such as Citi, \nverifying our customers’ identity is fundamental to safeguarding their finan -\ncial assets and protecting their privacy. Our aim is to deliver solutions that provide seamless, intuitive interactions with digital tools that won’t compromise personal data. To provide ongoing train -\ning for our employees, we have created digital identity learning packs that help build awareness of and skills related to new digital identity technologies. In addition, in 2019 we hosted an event called The Future of Digital Identity that engaged clients, partners, startups and Citi employees. Regardless of the varying perspectives the panelists brought to the event, there was consensus that data privacy and protection are central to advancements in digital identity. Their assessment was that regulations around the world and increased attention on privacy rights are elevating the need for more end-user control over personal information. \nWe are seeing advancements in decen -\ntralized identity that provide efficient \nsolutions that are more secure than traditional, centralized models and less cumbersome than maintaining multiple IDs and passwords. During 2019, Citi participated in a digital identity project with external partners to explore new decentralized approaches enabled by blockchain technology that build trust to create a secure exchange of informa -\ntion between unknown parties. We will continue to explore the latest trends and technology in this cutting-edge space, while working to implement secure, user-friendly solutions that meet our customers’ needs. \n95\nAt Citi, we actively seek out diverse perspectives at  \nall levels of our organization because we know that it  \nwill improve performance and boost innovation and  \nengagement. Over the last two years, we have elevated \nthe conversation around race, gender and equal pay for equal work. Our increased transparency, which in turn breeds accountability and credibility, is a force for  \nchange both inside and outside our company. While we recognize that we have much more to do, we are proud  \nof where we are headed. \nEngagement with our people throughout \ntheir careers at Citi, along with a commit -\nment to being a company with values that they can be proud of, is essential to our success. We are innovating how we \nengage with, recruit and develop talent; we are using data more effectively to \ndiagnose our challenges and areas of opportunity; and we have increased \naccountability for our representation \ngoals among people managers. In 2019, \nwe built out our analytics team to help \nus use evidence-based decision-making \nto better attract, retain and promote top \ntalent. This year, the team focused on \ngaining insights on a range of research \ntopics, including differentiating high- performing teams, female attrition \nand the impact of leaves of absence on \ncareer trajectories. One of the initial \nprojects was strengthening our employee \nsurvey by adding more questions related \nto experiences and perceptions.

Worldwide, women hold \nonly about one-third of corporate lead -\nership positions. Businesses have been working for decades to advance gender \nequality in the workplace, but progress \nhas been slow and results disappointing.\nAt Citi, we’ve pushed ourselves beyond \nour comfort zone — not just to acknowl -\nedge the stark realities laid bare in the statistics around pay equity, but also to recognize the social and cultural forces \nthat produced them. We are being open \nabout our data, what it means and what \nneeds to be done to meet our goals.\nIn 2019, we disclosed that, on an adjusted \nbasis, women globally are paid on \naverage more than 99 percent of what men are paid at Citi, and there was no statistically significant difference in \nadjusted compensation for U.S. minori -\nties and nonminorities. Following our review, we once again made appropriate \npay adjustments as part of our annual \ncompensation cycle.  \nWe also made a decision to be transpar -\nent about a statistic that our CEO has \ndescribed as “disappointing” and “ugly”: \nour unadjusted or “raw” pay gap\n1 for \nwomen and U.S. minorities. The analysis showed that Citi’s median pay for women \nglobally is 71 percent of the median for \nmen and that the median pay for U.S. \nminorities is 93 percent of the median \nfor nonminorities. An updated analysis \nreleased in early 2020 found those \nnumbers had moved slightly, but in the \nright direction, to 73 percent for women and 94 percent for U.S. minorities. For \nour company, the data reaffirms the \nimportance of goals we announced in \n2018 to increase our representation of \nwomen and U.S. minorities in senior and \nhigher-paying roles at Citi. (See more on \npage 98 .) We know that is the only effec -\ntive way for us to meaningfully reduce our raw pay gap over time.\n1 The raw pay gap is the difference between the median pay for all female employees and the median pay for all male \nemployees at Citi, and the difference between the median pay for minorities and nonminorities, not accounting for differences in factors such as job function, level or geography.Radical transparency certainly makes you \nuncomfortable, but it’s \nimportant to get out of the \nold habits. You’ve got to shake your thinking up and  \ndo something differently,  \nand that’s why it makes a  \ndifference.”\n— Jane Fraser, who was promoted in \n2019 to President of Citi and Chief \nExecutive Officer, Global Consumer \nBanking\nRaw Pay Gap Data\nCiti was the first company to disclose the aggregate measure of total compensation (i.e., all men vs. all women, all U.S. minorities vs. all U.S. nonminorities) across all employees regardless of role.\nMedian Pay\n2018 2019Equal Pay Better Representation Pay Equity\nFirm-Wide Representation Goals\nIncreased  \nRepresentation\nof women and \nminorities in higher-\ncompensated roles \nto help close the  \nraw pay gapsU.S. Minorities\nvs.U.S. NonminoritiesWomenvs.\nMen40%\n8%Mid- and senior- \nlevel female  talent globally to\nMid- and senior- \nlevel Black talent  (U.S. only) to+ =\n93%94%71%73%by \n2021\nby \n2021\n97\nOur work to address both pay measures \nis continuous, and the pace of change \nis likely to vary from year to year. As \npeople come in and out of the firm, as our \ncolleagues are promoted and as market \ndynamics change, these reviews serve as \nimportant measures of how we’re doing \non our commitment to pay colleagues \nequitably for their work and of the prog -\nress we’re making to increase diversity  \nat more senior levels at Citi.\nRepresentation Goals\nWe have set representation goals to increase diversity across the firm and \nhave focused our efforts on three key \nareas: targeted recruitment, development \nand retention, and promotion paths and \nprocesses. At a minimum, by the end of \n2021, we plan to improve the representa -\ntion of women in assistant vice president to managing director level roles to at \nleast 40 percent globally, up from  37 percent when we set the goals in 2018, \nand to boost the representation of Black \nemployees in those same roles in the  \nU.S. to at least 8 percent, up from the  \n6 percent 2018 baseline. Senior leaders \nat Citi were involved in the development \nof the goals and are now measured on \ntheir progress against them, just as they \nare for other business priorities.\nAs we work toward these goals, we are \ngaining valuable insight into the internal and external roadblocks that can make \ngrowing the pipeline of diverse talent \nand expanding diversity at senior levels \nchallenging — challenges that are shared \nacross many industries. As we learn, \nwe are able to implement changes that \nensure we sustainably move the needle \non our diversity metrics while supporting \nrepresentation across all diverse groups globally. \nSome have raised concerns that increas -\ning the focus on diversity and inclusion \nruns contrary to the idea of creating a \ntrue meritocracy. However, the myth of \nmeritocracy is that a level playing field, \nwhere there is equal opportunity for all \nto succeed, already exists. But, the most recent data from the National Center \nfor Education Statistics shows that \nwomen make up 47 percent of people \nreceiving graduate degrees from U.S. business schools. Yet the percentage of \nwomen who run Fortune 500 compa -\nnies declined in 2018 to 4.8 percent, down from 6.4 percent the prior year. \nSuch outcomes reinforce how deeply \nrooted and systemic these challenges \nare. Advantages are available to some \nbecause of their socioeconomic, \nacademic or cultural background, and reflecting a true meritocracy requires \nthat we eliminate the imbalance of \nwomen and minorities in our workforce \nby working to actually level the  \nplaying field. \nThese representation goals, as well as \nother work we are doing around gender \nequality in the workplace, directly \ncontribute to SDG 5 in support of  \ngender equality and empowering all \nwomen and girls. Specifically, we are enabling progress toward target 5.5 , \nwhich aims to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal oppor -\ntunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic \nand public life. \nSDG Goal 5:  Gender Equality \nInclusive Leadership \nWe engage our colleagues in creative \nways to help them understand the \nimportance of inclusive leadership at Citi and address unconscious bias and workplace micro-inequities head on. We \nkicked off 2019 with our second annual \nTogether at Citi: Building an Inclusive \nCulture event in which our CEO and our Affinity group leaders engaged employ -\nees in a robust discussion on inclusive leadership, transparency and belonging. \nThis session was complemented by four \nregional sessions on building an inclusive \nculture that were led by senior executives \nand Dr. Binna Kandola, co-founder of the \nbusiness psychology firm Pearn Kandola. \nIn these sessions, which engaged 8,500 colleagues, participants heard anecdotes \nfrom real employees about their personal \nexperiences with micro-inequities and the \nimpact those experiences have had on \nthem in the workplace. Participants also \nlearned strategies for building awareness \nof and mitigating micro-inequities.\nIn addition, we trained more than 4,500 \nhiring managers and Human Resources \ncolleagues to recognize and call out \npotential unconscious biases in their people decisions. We have created inter -\nactive sessions to recognize common unconscious biases and hold one another \naccountable to calling these out when we \nsee them.   \nIn July, New York University School of \nLaw Professor Kenji Yoshino presented \nhis research on “covering” — i.e., down -\nplaying our outsider attributes in order to blend into the mainstream — at Citi’s New \nYork headquarters. Professor Yoshino argued that we should find common \nground in our desire to be authentic —  \nShared prosperity will not be achieved in the  \nabsence of a strong commitment, coming from the \ntop, to equal pay for equal work and equal representation  \nin positions of seniority. It cannot be achieved if our \ncolleagues, no matter their position within an organization, don’t work in an environment where they feel like they belong and are free to contribute their talents to reach  \ntheir full potential.”\n— Michael L.

During the session, \nProfessor Yoshino offered concrete and \nactionable solutions to create and sustain \nan inclusive culture.\nOur Affinity Groups\nWith close to 200,000 colleagues in \nnearly 100 countries, our people reflect \nthe remarkable range of cultures and \nperspectives of our clients and custom -\ners. The breadth of backgrounds, expe -\nriences and perspectives of our team is \nwhat enables our success. \nOur Affinity model, built as a complement \nto our global, grassroots Employee \nNetwork program that has been in \nexistence for 18 years, is our enterprise \napproach to setting and reinforcing the company’s diversity priorities and goals. \nOur 10 Affinities — Asian Heritage, Black \nHeritage, Citi Salutes®, Citi Women, \nDisability, Generations, Hispanic/Latino \nHeritage, Multicultural, Families Matter \nand Pride — are designed to ensure that \nwe understand, appreciate and respond \nto the needs of our entire employee base. \nThe Affinities contribute to our efforts to \nhire, promote and retain diverse talent \nwhile also advocating for and engaging \nemployees and supporting our commu -\nnities. Members of our CEO’s leadership \nteam, along with other senior leaders \nacross the company, co-chair each \nAffinity to help provide accountability for \nan equitable and inclusive culture. The \nAffinity leaders act as public champions \nfor the priorities and needs of each \ndemographic, both within the company \nand externally. Another critical area of focus is ensur -\ning that our talent pipeline is more aggressively managed. We have been conducting pipeline analysis as part of \nannual succession planning in a number \nof units across the company. In 2019, we \nexpanded these efforts, enabling leaders \nto  ensure that we have the right mix of \ntalent who are ready now for promotion \nand that employees who are two to three \nyears away from their next roles have \nappropriate development plans in order to facilitate career mobility. \nOur new multimedia advertising campaign, The Moment, was created to further the discussion around the issue of pay equity and senior-level representation \ngaps — at Citi and beyond. The campaign, which kicked off in 2019 with a Times Square billboard, unveiled a series of photographs that capture the raw, unedited reactions of the children of Citi employees at the precise moment when they learn about the gender pay gap and unequal opportunities that persist across many industries. The full video, showcasing their real-time reactions, can be viewed on Citi’s website . \n99\nAffinities and Networks in Action: 2019\nOur Employee Network chapters serve as local branches of our Affinities and are initiated and \nled by employees. They offer professional development, mentoring, networking and community \nengagement opportunities to members and colleagues. Consistent with our inclusive culture, \nEmployee Network chapters are open to all Citi employees, whether or not they identify with a particular Affinity. Here we highlight a few examples of the efforts of these networks in 2019. \nFamilies Matter\nlaunched as a new Affinity, replacing the former \nParents network. Families Matter is designed to support employees through all stages of their lives by creating a culture of balance between \nwork and family life. \nCiti Women \nco-hosted the inaugural Equality Lounge and two \nequality panels alongside The Female Quotient at the 2019 Milken Institute Global Conference. During these panels, Citi senior executives \ndiscussed our diversity and inclusion work, \nincluding our gender equality efforts, with more than 200 Citi clients.\nBlack Heritage \nsponsored the Owning My Success group coaching program for high-performing Black employees for the second year, increasing the number of participants by 85 percent from 2018.  \nEmployee Networks \nby Region\n101\nNorth America45\nEurope, Middle \nEast and Africa\n17\nLatin America24\nAsia PacificHispanic/Latino Heritage \nhosted philanthropist Luis A.

By understanding the demographic makeup of our employees, we will be better able to make strategic decisions around recruitment and develop -\nment. In 2019, we continued to expand the demographic questions in our Voice of the Employee survey, including those on sexual orientation and gender identity, to 39 coun -\ntries, reaching 82 percent of our employee base. We plan to expand similar voluntary self-ID in our human resources profiles. \nWe are a signatory to the Human Rights \nCampaign’s Business Statement for Transgender Equality and are proud to have reaffirmed our commitment to stand with the millions of people in America who identify as transgender or gender nonbinary or who are intersex. Through this public demonstration of support, we aim to encour -\nage others to treat people who are part of this community with the respect and dignity they deserve. \nIn 2018, we expanded our new global \nbadging policy to enable our transgender colleagues to more easily change the name on their Citi identification badge. \nCiti was a founding member of the Stonewall \nGlobal Program and continues to work with other organizations advancing LGBT+ rights, including the Human Rights Campaign, Out Leadership and Out & Equal. Also, we were awarded the highest score on the Human Rights Campaign’s LGBTQ Corporate Equality Index for the 15th consecutive year.\nSee the Communities section  to learn about \nour work to support inclusion through our \npartners.Citi operates in many countries and jurisdic -\ntions where LGBT+ rights are not yet legally \nand socially accepted. We recognize the \nchallenges faced by the community and our \ncolleagues in some of these countries. We \nare committed to ensuring that the rights \nof all LGBT+ employees are fully respected, \ncovered by Citi policies and reflected in the \ndiversity of our workplaces.\nWe have expanded insurance and other \nbenefits available under our U.S. policies \nto LGBT+ partners globally wherever the \nbenefits are legal and permitted under local \nlaw, such as in Brazil, Hong Kong, India, \nMexico, Singapore and Taiwan. In addition \nto designating a spouse through marriage \nor civil partnership, employees are able \nto designate a “partner” of any sex as an \neligible family member. We recognize that \nemployee benefits are critical to ensuring \nequality and mobility for our colleagues. \nCiti views self-identification as a strategic \npriority for our diversity and inclusion \nefforts, including for our LGBT+ employees. \nMore and more companies are embracing \nself-ID as a way for diverse employees \nto raise their hands to be counted and \nacknowledged. We believe that self-ID \ncommunicates to our employees that we Citi rang the closing bell at the New York Stock \nExchange in recognition of Pride Month and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in New York City. We also replaced the red arc of our logo \nwith a rainbow in solidarity. \nIn 2019, we became a signatory to:\n •The Business Coalition for the Equality Act , to support federal legislation to provide the \nsame basic protections to LGBT+ people as are provided to other protected groups under \nfederal law; and\n •A U.S. Supreme Court amicus brief in support of workplace LGBT+ protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Working in partnership with the Human Rights Campaign and other advocacy groups, Citi joined more than 200 companies to send a powerful and unequivocal message in support of LGBT+ equality.\nLGBT+ Equality and Rights\nWe recruit the best talent and give them opportunities \nfor success and mobility. This explicitly includes ensuring that LGBT+ candidates and employees have \naccess to a safe, inclusive and diverse workplace. In \norder to do that, we must confront unconscious biases and make certain that our policies are inclusive for all. \n101\nTeam USA Paralympic athletes Nicky Nieves and \nTrey Jenifer talk with Citi employees about the thrills of competing on the Paralympic stage\nIn 2019, our Disability Affinity led an effort \nto evaluate Citi’s assistive technologies and the accommodations we provide for employ -\nees with disabilities. These include Braille display technology, captioned telephones and desktop magnifiers. As a result, we launched a firm-wide accessibility resource center, formed an assistive technologies working group composed of employees with disabilities, and established a dedicated channel for resolving assistive technology issues.\nOur commitment to disability inclusion also \nextends beyond our firm to the communities we serve. We have been proud supporters of the Paralympic Movement and Para athletes since 2012. In December 2018, we announced our global, mission-led part -\nnership with the International Paralympic Committee and 18 National Paralympic Committees. We are also supporting more than 40 Para athletes as they prepare for the Tokyo Paralympic games. Our aim is to shine a spotlight on the worldwide Para Movement, engage colleagues across the globe and help to change perceptions of people with disabilities. We are also working to offer resources that improve economic opportunity and financial stability for all, including those living with disabilities.

But we will never make \nprogress increasing the representation \nof female and minority talent at all levels \nof the firm without focusing on how we \nbring new colleagues into Citi.\nOur goal is for our analyst and associate \nprograms to include 50 percent female colleagues globally and 30 percent Black \nand Hispanic/Latino colleagues in the \nU.S. Female representation in full-time \nanalyst and associate roles globally \nincreased from 35 percent in 2018 to \n45 percent in 2019. Likewise, women in \nsummer analyst and associate roles  \nhave increased from 42 percent to  \n47 percent over the same time period.  In the U.S., our Black and Hispanic/Latino \nrepresentation has increased from  \n14 percent in 2018 to 18 percent in 2019, \nwith our summer representation increas -\ning from 17 percent to 26 percent over the same time frame. \nFor managing director and director level \nhires, we continue to ensure diverse \nslates, including at least one woman in \nour interviews for global hires and at \nleast one woman or racial/ethnic minority in our interviews for U.S. hires. In 2019, \n68 percent of interview slates for manag -\ning director and director roles included at least one diverse candidate.  \nIn addition, we utilize trainings and \ntechnology designed to help us leverage \nour hiring process to drive greater diver -\nsity, including interview training for all recruiters and hiring managers and new \nsourcing platforms. \nCampus Recruiting \nCampus recruiting is imperative to \nestablishing Citi as an employer of choice \namong early-career professionals. Our Early Insights Programs target fresh -\nmen and sophomores, focusing on iden -\ntifying, mentoring and hiring top diverse \ntalent for summer analyst programs \nacross the firm. These programs, provide \nearly exposure to and education regard -\ning Citi’s businesses, technical training, \nmentorship and Citi’s culture.  •Freshman Discovery Day is a two-day \nexploratory program that helps edu -\ncate underrepresented minority col -\nlege freshmen on the various roles in \nfinancial services. After the program, \nparticipants are paired with a mentor \nfrom Citi and have the opportunity \nto participate in recruiting activity. \nApproximately 40 percent of the \nHBCU Innovation and Leadership Symposium\nIn 2019, we held our inaugural HBCU Innovation and Leadership Sympo -\nsium, which brought together 85 first- and second-year students from 21 historically black colleges and universities for an introductory experience \nfocused on helping them understand financial services, gain technical skills \nand kickoff the career planning process. The two-day immersive experience \ngave participants an opportunity to network with other HBCU students from \nacross the U.S. and participate in workshops to share and discuss the rich \nexperiences of professionals at Citi. The symposium provided an overview of \ntopics such as career preparedness, entrepreneurship and personal financial \nmanagement. While we would like the students to consider the possibility of a future with Citi, our primary goal was to provide them with helpful tools on \ntheir path to professional success, without regard for industry or profession. \nThe symposium not only allowed us to build relationships with individual \nstudents, but strengthened our engagement with their universities as well — \na key priority as we work to expand the network of institutions from which we \npursue talent.\n107\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nstudents who participate in Freshman \nDiscovery Day typically move on to \nour Sophomore Leadership Program.\n •The Early Identification Leadership \nProgram focuses on identifying, \nmentoring and hiring diverse talent \nfor our summer analyst programs \nover a five-week period. The program \npairs each participant with a mentor \nfrom Citi and provides access to a \nvirtual learning tool that includes \nweekly virtual trainings, as well as \nvirtual panels and seminars given by Citi professionals. \n •Through training, hands-on work experience, mentorship and peer \nnetworking, participants in the \nSophomore Leadership Program \nreceive early opportunities to build \nthe skills necessary for our full-time \nanalyst programs. More than  \n95 percent of program participants \nreceive an offer to return for their \njunior summer. \nIn an effort to expand our reach beyond our traditional target schools and \nattract a wider variety of applicants, we \nhave been exploring various proactive \nemployee recruiting methods. By partner -\ning with companies such as Jopwell and \nWayUp, which are U.S.-based recruiting \nplatforms for diverse students, recruiters \nhave been able to communicate custom -\nized messages to promote our oppor -\ntunities and more directly engage with \ndiverse talent. We also leverage oppor -\ntunities to meet students in person. For example, we participated in the National \nBlack MBA Association Conference, which convenes Black professionals and \nMBAs, corporate partners and thought \nleaders for a week of career develop -\nment. Through this event, we engaged with some 500 attendees, distributing \nresumes to our recruiters and guiding \nconference attendees as they apply for \nCiti jobs. This engagement provides an \nopportunity to expand our pipeline and be purposeful in our targeting approach.\n Our Citi® University Partnerships in \nInnovation & Discovery (CUPID) Program \nenables us to accelerate innovation \nprojects across Citi by engaging diverse \nstudents and developing a robust pipe -\nline of talent from leading universities. Learn more about CUPID in the Digital  \nInnovation section .Development and \nRetention\nOur best chance of making meaningful \nimprovements in diversity at more \nsenior levels is to ensure we cultivate the \ndiverse talent we already have and give \nour people career momentum. We will \ncontinue our focus on pay equity for all \nof our employees and also provide access \nto a robust range of career development \nand learning resources.  \n108\nWe offer a broad range of firm-wide \nglobal development programs and \nempower business leaders to create \nemployee programs that are tailored to \nthe unique needs of their organizations, \nbecause a one-size-fits-all approach to \ndevelopment will not foster diversity \nat senior levels. Moreover, we want to \nreinforce a spirit of innovation among \nour leaders, allowing them to test new approaches that will better enable our \nfirm to figure out what works and what \ndoesn’t.\nIn the last few years, business leaders \nhave piloted a range of programs, primar -\nily focusing on mentorship, leadership development and skills development. \nIn each case, programs are designed to \nprovide access to senior leaders, foster \ncommunity support and meet employees \nwhere they are in the development process — helping them understanding \ntheir own unique skills and building their \npersonal brands. \nLearning and \nEvaluation\nProviding our employees with access \nto quality learning resources is critical \nto enhancing their ability to perform in \ntheir current roles and prepare for future \nopportunities. In 2019, we provided train -\ning to all Citi employees. We offer flexible solutions that enable learning when, \nwhere and how it is most effective for \nemployees, and we continue to expand \nour program offerings. As we enhance these offerings, we are working to \nformally capture employee feedback on \nprogramming to better understand the \nimpact on employees and the potential \nfor further enhancement. \nDigital Learning \nIn order to help our employees learn in a rapidly changing world, we offer Degreed, \nan online platform that delivers infor -\nmation on the topics employees want to learn about, from artificial intelligence to cybersecurity to effective communication \nskills. Employees can choose from a series of recommendations that can be \npersonalized for each individual. In 2019, \nmore than 120,000 employees accessed \nDegreed, with leadership and data analyt -\nics among the skills most frequently added to individual profiles. \nTraining for Advancement\nWe provide a range of internal develop -\nment and rotational programs for leaders at all levels, and we continue to evolve \nthose learning programs to meet new \nneeds. Our Global Consumer Operations \nprograms help high-performing employ -\nees build the skills needed to transition to manager and supervisory roles, and \n80 percent of participants have been \npromoted or are on a promotion path.\nOur Global Associate Learning Initiative \nis a nine-month training program aimed at Institutional Client Group employees \nat the associate level — a critical mile -\nstone early in an employee’s career. The program, which combines digital learning \nwith in-person training, prepares the \nnext generation of Citi leadership for the \nfuture of banking. In 2019, we hosted 450 \nglobal associates (representing 40  \ncountries and 50 cities) at our New York headquarters for the inaugural event. Evaluation\nEmployees receive formal feedback from their managers through midyear and \nyear-end reviews. Our two-rating system \nevaluates employee performance against \ntheir goals and assesses their leadership \nthrough the lens of our Leadership \nStandards. Citi also encourages employ -\nees and their managers to create indi -\nvidual development plans that consider \nthe skills, strategic training opportunities and behaviors needed to enhance current \nperformance and prepare for future \nroles. These plans are created as part \nof midyear and year-end reviews, and \nemployees are able to use digital and \nin-person training resources to execute \ntheir development plans and enhance \ntheir skills.  \nBeginning in 2019, all Citi employees have \nthe ability to request feedback from and \nprovide feedback to colleagues in real time, while managers can also ask for \nfeedback on team members throughout \nthe year. In addition, more than 2,700 \nmanagers who participated in training \nprograms received a 360-degree perfor -\nmance review, which is designed to help identify opportunities for development.Addressing the Needs of New Managers\nAs a new generation begins managing for the first time, Citi has been refreshing the \npreparation and support we provide to help them succeed in their new roles. In 2019,  \nwe hosted design thinking sessions to help us better understand the needs of new  \nmanagers. Through eight, one-day sessions around the world, we brought together 150 \nnew managers from different backgrounds and countries to identify common challenges \nand develop creative solutions. The challenges participants identified included the need \nfor a better way to connect to peers to share best practices; a desire for more easily  \naccessible tools to address management questions; and a demand for digital resources \nthat curate the most relevant information new managers need as they transition to their \nnew roles. Based on our findings, we have launched a new program called Welcome to Citi Management that brings together new managers to address these shared challenges in \nan interactive, participant-driven format, and provides them with a digital “placemat” that \nputs a range of essential resources at their fingertips. \n109\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nPromotion Paths  \nand Processes\nA critical part of guiding our employ -\nees’ career progressions is working to \nbetter understand what works and what \ndoesn’t so we can not only retain but \nalso promote our talent. Career devel -\nopment is an important priority, and we promote from within wherever possible. \nIn 2019, 38 percent of open positions \nwere filled internally. This focus is partic -\nularly important for our diverse talent \nas we work to increase representation \nat more senior levels of the company. \nFor example, with immense focus and \ncontinued investment in development, \nmore than 28 percent of our Citi Country \nOfficers (our country business heads) \nare female, and our ultimate goal is to \nincrease this to 50 percent. \nWe have been focused on equipping \nmanagers to better anticipate and learn \nabout employee concerns and to partner to develop solutions that help them \nretain and promote key talent. Managers \nare encouraged and supported to look \nbeyond formal talent review conver -\nsations to have candid conversations, or engagement interviews, with direct reports to build trust and better under -\nstand employees’ career aspirations and morale. Managers are also encouraged to consider existing talent when filling open opportunities. Take, for example, \nthe Institutional Client Group’s Candidate \nCare program, which was launched in \nGlobal Employee Training in 2019\nAverage Hours per Employee Total Hours by Training Format\n40.1\nTotal37.2\nNorth  \nAmerica36.7\nEurope, Middle \nEast and Africa5.4 M\nWeb-Based8.0 M\n Total\n37.2\nAsia Pacific2.6 M\nInstructor-Led 51.0\nLatin AmericaVoice of the Employee\nOur annual Voice of the Employee survey gathers critical input on trends in the work -\nplace and management practices, serving as an important catalyst for implementing \nchange within our company. All employees are invited to participate and have their \nvoices heard. \nIn 2019, the survey’s Engagement Index — which measures employees’ sentiments \nregarding opportunities for growth, job alignment with skills and perception that the \ncompany is making the changes necessary to compete — came in at 76 percent, the \nsame as in 2018.\nWe also measure sentiments about diversity. The Diversity Index covers a range of \nfactors, including employees’ perceptions of:\n •Senior management support for diverse backgrounds and ideas \n •Equal opportunity for success at Citi, regardless of background or differences\n •Being treated with respect at work\n •Manager support for efforts to balance work and personal life\n •Good ideas being adopted regardless of who suggested them\n •The ability to be oneself at work\nThe Diversity Index for 2019 was 81 percent, the same as in 2018. \n110\n2019 to help increase the pipeline of \nminority lateral hires. Through this \nprogram, senior Citi managers increase \ntheir network of potential talent, in part \nby meeting with high-potential talent \nbefore there is a job opening. When \nthere is an opening, internal referrals \ncomplement recommendations from the \nCiti alumni network and search firms, and \nCiti maintains contact with candidates, including those who are internal, through \na cadence of in-person and virtual  \ncheck-ins.\nWe also maintain an employee nomina -\ntion guide for managers, which can be \nused to help identify employees for open \nroles, development programs, special \nassignments and promotions. The guide \naims to reinforce effective practices for \nfair, balanced and inclusive promotion \ndecisions.\nWorkforce Well-Being \nMaintaining a culture of well-being for our employees is critical to our success. We \ncontinually evaluate the tools and policies \navailable to maintain the well-being of our \nglobal workforce. \nWork/Life Balance\nCiti realizes the importance of being \nflexible on how, when and where work \ngets done. We have a variety of programs \nthat help employees balance their work \nand life, including both formal and infor -\nmal remote work arrangements and flex schedules. Providing opportunities for \nflextime, compressed workweeks, job \nsharing and reduced schedules improves \nemployee satisfaction and retention while increasing productivity. \nOur Minds at Citi initiative aims to destig -\nmatize and address issues of mental \nhealth. While specific resources can vary \nby country, we provide access to free and \nconfidential counseling and life coaching \nsessions. The program enables employ -\nees to seek support for a wide range of personal issues, such as stress, relation -\nship conflicts and financial challenges, as well as workplace challenges, such \nas communicating with managers and \ndealing with organizational change. In the \nUK, Australia and New Zealand, we offer \nmental health training to help managers \nrecognize when employees may be expe -\nriencing issues that impact their mental \nhealth and to provide guidance on how \nto respond and offer support. We are \nworking to expand such efforts to the U.S. \nAs we strive to create a culture in which \neveryone feels supported and valued, \nwe recognize that mental well-being and \nphysical health must both be supported. \nIn 2019, we started offering enhanced \nmental health benefits for employees and \ntheir families, including telemedicine- \nbased behavioral health options, on-site mental health professionals at our \nlargest locations, and Sleepio, a behavior \nmodification therapy program designed \nto build better sleep habits and improve \nmental health. And, through our learning \nand development efforts, we offer oppor -\ntunities to learn about mental health and strategies for helping others who might \nbe affected. \nIn the U.S., our on-site medical clinics \nprovide healthcare, free preventative \nscreenings and health promotion \nprograms, immunizations and pre-travel \nhealth guidance to all employees. \nThese initiatives help employees and \ntheir families achieve their health goals \nthrough resources that are free, easy to \nuse and available to employees whether or not they are enrolled in a Citi health \nplan. Our Live Well Rewards program in \nthe U.S. enables employees and their \nspouses or partners who are enrolled \nin our medical plans to earn up to $450 \n($900 for a couple) in Live Well Rewards \njust for practicing healthy behaviors such \nas tracking their exercise, participating in \nbiometric screenings or taking an online course in how to lose weight or start an \nexercise program. More than 57,000 \nemployees in the U.S. earned Live Well \nRewards in 2019. Rewards are offered in the form of gift cards to popular retailers. \nOur locations in the U.S. and Mexico are \ntobacco-free. \nWe also offer a Health Advocate program \nin the U.S., separate from insurance \nprograms, to aid employees in resolving \ninsurance claims, accessing medical \nspecialists and addressing their health needs and those of their families. We also \nconsider how our buildings can affect our \nemployees. From providing ergonomic \nfurniture to managing air and acoustics, \nwe strive to create an environment that \nsupports the well-being and productivity \nof our employees. Learn more about how \nphysical space impacts employee well- \nbeing in the Operations and Supply Chain section . Also, our Save Well plans guide \nour employees in building financial stabil -\nity and saving for retirement, and we \noffer a tuition reimbursement option for \ncertain employees going back to school. \nCiti Benefits and  \nFamily Life\nSupporting employees in their family life \nis an important part of workforce well- \nbeing. We believe all parents deserve \ntime to adjust to parenthood and bond \nwith the newest members of their fami -\nlies. That’s why we recently expanded our Paid Parental Leave Policy to include \nCiti employees around the world. The \nnew policy, which began rolling out in \nearly 2020, applies to every kind of family and includes a new parental paid \nleave minimum everywhere we operate. \nAt a minimum, all Citi employees will be \neligible for 16 weeks of paid maternity \nleave and four weeks of paid parental \nleave. Maternity leave applies to all birth -\ning parents while parental leave covers all nonbirthing parents, regardless of \ngender or type of birth (e.g., adoption or surrogacy). \nEmployees working in countries that offer \nlonger periods of paid leave time will \ncontinue to maintain their benefits.\n111\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nWe recognize that our parental leave \nbenefit only adds value if our employees \nactually take the time that is offered to \nthem. We know that some new parents \nmay be reluctant to take time off after \nadding to their families, and we aim to \nfoster a culture that supports employees \nin making this decision. \nWe also offer employees discounts for \ndependent care, and we provide a new \nparent program for both men and women \nas they navigate the transition to parent -\nhood. In addition, we offer the Bright \nHorizons Special Needs program, which \nprovides online resources for parents in \nthe U.S. with special needs children and \nsubsidized dependent care when work-\n|related issues disrupt regular schedules. \nWe also offer a college coach to help \nfamilies and their children navigate the \npost-secondary education admissions process. In addition, we have policies for \nemployees who require paid time off for \nreasons such as military or medical leave.\nVolunteerism \nWe offer our employees resources and tools to volunteer in the communities in \nwhich they live and work, and, in turn, \nour employees are proud to contribute to \nhelping individuals and families thrive. \nIn 2019, Citi employee volunteers contrib -\nuted more than 1 million volunteer hours \nin communities around the world.  \nOur colleagues used their professional \nskills, expertise and time volunteering \nwith community organizations to support \na range of projects, from traditional hands-on activities to skills-based volun -\nteering. These employee engagement efforts with community organizations \noften complement financial support \nfrom Citi and the Citi Foundation. To help \nencourage employee engagement in \ncommunities, every active and qualified \nCiti employee is entitled to one paid day \neach year to volunteer with an eligible nonprofit organization of their choice.While Citi employees volunteer year-round, Global Community Day, our annual \nday of service for employees, friends and \nfamily, is an important way in which we \ncollectively deepen relationships with our \ncommunities. In 2019, 120,000 volunteers \nparticipated in more than 1,500 events \nheld in 400 cities across 90 countries. \nSince the inaugural Global Community \nDay in 2006, Citi volunteers have contributed more than 4 million hours of \nservice to projects in hundreds of cities. \nWe also track how Global Community Day \nevents are helping to advance the UN \nSustainable Development Goals. \nFair Employment  \nPractices\nWe strive to maintain an environment \nin which opportunities to develop are \nwidely available, where people are hired \nand advanced on their merits and where \nour employees treat each other with \nrespect. We are fully committed to equal \nemployment opportunity and comply \nwith the letter and spirit of all laws \nregarding fair employment practices and \nnondiscrimination. \nFor more information on fair employment \npractices, see the Human Rights section of this report as well as our Code of \nConduct . \nCompensation\nWe offer competitive salaries based on \nour Compensation Philosophy, which \noutlines our five primary objectives ( see \nbox on on page 113 ). Our approach to \ncompensation includes ensuring that \nentry-level employees receive compet -\nitive wages within the industry, and in June, we raised our minimum wage in \nthe U.S. to $15 per hour. We also offer \nemployees the opportunity to take advan -\ntage of formal or informal flexible work \narrangements, including part-time work \nand job sharing. We conduct a robust annual review of compensation, which includes multiple \nlayers of reviews of compensation \nrecommendations and pay equity anal -\nysis. Learn more about our pay equity analysis . \nExecutive Compensation\nWe compensate our executives fairly, based on individual and company \nperformance, competitive benchmarking \nand support of our Mission and Value \nProposition. Our Proxy Statement \ncontains a scorecard with each named \nexecutive officer’s financial and \nnonfinancial performance goals, which \nare approved by the Board’s Personnel \nand Compensation Committee. We seek to design our executive pay program to \nmotivate balanced behaviors consistent \nwith our focus on long-term strategic \ngoals. For example, diversity and inclu -\nsion, including increasing the represen -\ntation of women and U.S. minorities, and \nethics and culture are incorporated into \nsenior executives’ scorecards, which are a \nfactor in remuneration. Citi incorporates shareholder and stakeholder input on \nexecutive pay into our Compensation \nPhilosophy. We apply our Compensation \nPhilosophy through our Executive \nCompensation Framework, which enables \nincentive compensation awards to \nclosely reflect our pay-for-performance \napproach. \nDiscrimination and  \nSexual Harassment  \nin the Workplace\nCiti strictly prohibits any form of unlawful \ndiscrimination or harassment, as set forth \nin our widely disseminated and consis -\ntently enforced policies. Employees who believe they have been discriminated \nagainst or harassed are encouraged to \nreport any incidents that violate Citi’s pol -\nicies to their managers, another member of the employee’s management chain, \nHuman Resources, or the Ethics Hotline. \n112\nCariClub:  Since 2017, CariClub has been \nhelping Citi bankers engage with their \ncommunities and develop leadership expe -\nrience by serving on nonprofit associate boards. Through this external resource, more than 80 Citi colleagues are now serving on an associate board or have joined a young professionals committee, and an additional 80 colleagues will be working through the process in 2019. Citi offers the program to employees who have been with the firm for three to seven years. Most participants are between the ages of 25  \nand 35.\niMentor: Since the launch of our Pathways \nto Progress program in 2014, the Citi \nFoundation and iMentor have worked together to equip high school students with the tools to succeed academically and prepare for post-secondary education and career opportunities. In addition to the Foundation’s grant funding, more than  \n130 Citi employees across the U.S. served  \nas mentors in 2019, helping to develop college and career aspirations, assist with the college application and financing process and coach mentees throughout their post-secondary academic years.   Service Year: Through a partnership with Service Year Alliance, select first-year Citi analysts in New York City who have accepted a full-time offer have the oppor -\ntunity to defer that offer for one year to work in a strategic role at a nonprofit of their choice. With a guaranteed return to Citi after their year of service, partici -\npants contribute their skills and expertise to supporting their communities while honing skills that will prove valuable in their careers at Citi. Since the program’s inception in 2016, 32 Citi colleagues have participated. \nVolunteer Africa: Launched in 2016, \nVolunteer Africa connects microentrepre -\nneurs in Africa with Citi employee volun -\nteers from select areas of our business. In 2019, 24 junior bankers spent five weeks in Kenya supporting 16 high-potential entrepreneurs to help grow their businesses and create much-needed jobs in the local community. The entrepreneurs are also able to pitch for investment from Citi through a dedicated fund established by the bank. Research on previous entrepreneurs partic -\nipating in the program in Kenya found that, on average, entrepreneurs experienced a  41 percent increase in income and a  \n53 percent increase in profit nine months after completing the program.\nOne Young World:  As part of the One Young \nWorld program, select Citi employees \nparticipate in a six-month mentorship program with young social entrepreneurs from Yunus&Youth, an organization that promotes social entrepreneurship by connecting business leaders with the next generation of social entrepreneurs. Participants also attend the annual One Young World Summit, where they debate, formulate and share innovative solutions for the world’s most pressing issues and bring these ideas back to their work-  \nplaces. In 2019, alumni of the program convened a panel of senior executives to bring awareness to Citi’s efforts around  \nthe Sustainable Development Goals. An additional 43 colleagues participated in  \nthe program in 2019.  \nService and Skills\nAmong our volunteer opportunities, we provide immersive experiences that \nserve as valuable professional and personal development for our employees and important retention tools for Citi. They also contribute to our commitment \nto engaging with the communities where we live and work. These opportunities \ninclude the following: Citi employee participating in \nVolunteer Africa in Kenya\n113\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nUpon receipt of any complaint, Citi \npromptly investigates and takes remedial \nmeasures up to and including termination \nof employment, where appropriate. All \ncontacts and investigations are treated \nas confidentially as possible, consistent \nwith the need to investigate and address \nthe matter and subject to applicable laws \nand regulations. Citi’s policies also strictly \nprohibit retaliation against any employee who has made a complaint or participated \nin an investigation. For more on our dis -\ncrimination and harassment policies, see our Code of Conduct . \nIn 2019, we updated our U.S. Workplace Anti-Harassment Training Program. Our \nrefreshed training incorporates learnings \nand best practices, such as bystander \nintervention, and provides additional \nexamples of the types of conduct that \nconstitute sexual harassment or discrim -\nination.  The training gives all employees \ninformation and tools on how to recog -\nnize, address and escalate workplace \nharassment or discrimination when it \noccurs. We are committed to a diverse \nand inclusive workforce built on the \nfoundation that all employees treat one \nanother with respect and dignity  \nand are comfortable coming to work  \neach day. What’s Ahead\nOur goals for improving representation and pay equity at Citi are important markers \nfor our progress in building a diverse and inclusive culture, particularly at the most \nsenior levels. We will continue to focus on data-driven insights and engagement with \nour employees to inform the steps we take to propel organizational change. Our hope \nis that by achieving these goals in the short term, we will build the foundation for \nmore ambitious goals down the line. We are also committed to continuing to extend \nour efforts beyond our firm, using our financial resources, the time and talents of our \npeople, and our corporate voice to advance progress around issues of diversity and \ninclusion globally, whether we’re helping to change perceptions of people with disabili -\nties through our sponsorship of athletes or advocating for LGBT+ equality through our \nsupport of legislative action.Citi’s Compensation Philosophy\nWe have a comprehensive compensation philosophy anchored by the following  \nfive objectives:\n •Align compensation programs, structures and decisions with shareholder and other stake -\nholder interests \n •Reinforce a business culture based on the highest ethical standards \n •Manage risks to Citi by encouraging prudent decision-making \n •Reflect regulatory guidance in compensation programs \n •Attract and retain the best talent to lead Citi to success\nFor more detailed information on each of these objectives, see our complete  Compensation Philosophy . \n114\nEthics and Culture\nEthics and Culture \nat Citi \nEach Citi employee has made a commit -\nment to earn and maintain our clients’ \ntrust, in every transaction and every interaction, by responsibly providing our \nproducts, services and expertise. We \nexpect our employees to comply with \nall applicable laws, regulations and Citi \npolicies — including our Code of Conduct . \nOur Mission and Value Proposition asks our employees globally to ensure that \ntheir decisions pass three tests: They are in our clients’ interests; they create economic value; and they are always \nsystemically responsible. \nThese three tests help our employees \nto deliver on our core activities of safe -\nguarding assets, lending money, making payments and accessing capital markets \non behalf of our clients — each of which \ncreates an obligation to act responsibly, \ndo everything possible to create the best \noutcomes and prudently manage risk. \nThe Ethics, Conduct and Culture \nCommittee of our Board of Directors \noversees Citi’s efforts to foster a culture of ethics and appropriate conduct within \nthe organization. At Citi, we establish \nand communicate our core values and \nprinciples through our Code of Conduct, \nour Leadership Standards , various We continue to invest in improving ethics-related controls, \nincluding those related to risk, compliance and auditing, enabling us to safely run and grow our business. All \nof our employees, at all levels, are held to the highest \nstandards of ethical and professional behavior so we can deliver the best possible results for our clients, customers and communities. Our governance structure helps us to \nidentify and learn from our mistakes and hold ourselves \naccountable for our actions. Ethical fitness\nWe launched the Ethical Fitness campaign to \nget our employees in their best ethical shape\nPage 116A commitment from the top\nGlobally, senior leaders have been reinforcing \nthe importance of ethical decision-making\nPage 118HIGHLIGHTS\n115\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \ntraining and development opportunities, \nemployee engagement initiatives and \ncommunications from our senior leaders. \nIn doing so, we reinforce that our employ -\nees must apply our values and principles every day to everything they do, wher -\never Citi operates. \nCode of Conduct \nCiti’s Code of Conduct outlines the \nstandards of ethics and professional \nbehavior expected of employees and \nrepresentatives of Citi when dealing \nwith clients, business colleagues, share -\nholders, communities and each other. It also provides an overview of key legal \nand regulatory requirements and select \nglobal policies. The Code applies to all \ndirectors, officers and employees of Citi worldwide. In addition, individuals \nperforming services for Citi may be \nsubject to the Code by contract or agree -\nment. To best serve our global workforce, the Code is published in 21 languages \nand is publicly available on our Investor  \nRelations website . \nUpdated in 2019 and approved by our \nBoard of Directors, the Code of Conduct \nis fundamental to fostering our culture \nof integrity. Our Code illustrates how members of our workforce can make \nethical decisions using a decision-making \nguide that identifies key criteria through \nwhich a proposed choice or course of \naction should pass in order to align with \nthe tests contained in our Mission and \nValue Proposition  and our Leadership \nStandards. It reinforces for employees their responsibility to adhere to our core \nvalues while leading by example, being \naccountable for their decisions and esca -\nlating actual or potential misconduct. The Code emphasizes that, when in doubt, \nemployees should always err on the side \nof escalation.\nUpon joining Citi, employees must \nacknowledge that they have read and  \nwill comply with the Code. Violations  of the Code can result in disciplinary \naction up to and including termination  \nof employment. \nWe ask employees to periodically reaffirm \ntheir commitment to comply with the \nCode through Code of Conduct training. \nThe training is required following the \nissuance of an updated Code of Conduct. \nAs such, new training was launched \nfor all employees in early 2020. The \ntraining serves as an essential means to connect Citi’s values and principles \nto expected employee behaviors and \nconduct. Through the use of hypothet -\nical work-related ethical scenarios, the training is designed to help employees \nmake ethical decisions by having them \napply — to common workplace situations \n— the principles in Citi’s Code of Conduct, \nMission and Value Proposition, applicable laws and Citi policies. The training also \nemphasizes employees’ obligation to \npromptly report actual or suspected misconduct, providing information on the various resources available to them to do \nso. Code of Conduct training is provided \nto new hires globally on a rolling basis, \nas well as to nonemployee contingent \nworkers who are performing services  \nfor Citi. \nWe ask our colleagues to ensure \nthat their decisions pass three \ntests: \n •They are in our clients’ interests \n •They create economic value \n •They are always systemically \nresponsible \nStaying on Top of Your Ethical Game\nIn 2019, we launched Ethical Fitness, a global campaign led by our executive \nmanagement team to provide Citi colleagues with the equipment they need \nto get in their best ethical shape. A series of seven modules that incorporate \nsenior leader videos, storytelling and manager support gives employees the \nopportunity to practice consistently making the right ethical decisions. The \nfirst module, launched in December, focused on the factors that contribute \nto unethical decision-making, to help employees identify, anticipate and build \nresilience to these influencing factors. The campaign will continue through \n2020. Voice of the Employee \nAs part of Citi’s annual Voice of the  \nEmployee survey, an initiative to gather \nfeedback from our employees, we include \nan Ethical Culture Index. This index  \nmeasures five items:\n •Comfort with reporting unethical prac -\ntices without fear of reprisal\n •A feeling of accountability to identify  \nand escalate issues\n •Confidence that Citi will act upon reported legal or ethical violations\n •A belief that colleagues act with integrity\n •Manager encouragement of ethical conduct even in the face of pressure\nIndex results have held steady for several \nyears, with 89 percent responding posi-\ntively to the index items in 2019, the same \nas in 2018.  \n116\nEscalating Business and \nEthical Concerns\nWe emphasize to our employees the \nimportance of escalating issues in Citi’s \nglobal Escalation Policy. The Escalation \nPolicy clearly sets forth employees’ \nobligation to escalate violations or poten -\ntial violations of law, rule or regulation, or breach or potential breach of Citi policy \nor procedure or the Code of Conduct. \nThe Escalation Policy also provides infor -\nmation on the multiple avenues through \nwhich employees can raise issues, includ -\ning, among others, to their managers or other members of management, their \nHuman Resources or labor relations \nrepresentatives, internal legal counsel, a \ndesignated Independent Compliance Risk \nManagement (ICRM) officer, Citi Security \nand Investigative Services and the Ethics \nHotline. \nThe Escalation Policy was updated in \n2019 to add requirements for prompt escalation and reporting of significant \nmatters to senior management and \nto the appropriate legal entities and \nBoard committees. The policy sets forth \nrequirements on what to escalate, when \nto escalate and the parties to whom to \nescalate. It includes roles and responsi -\nbilities for the identification, reporting, investigation, resolution and senior management reporting of these concerns \nand for oversight of escalation require -\nments and processes. \nAs part of Citi’s escalation resources, the \nEthics Hotline provides multiple channels \nfor employees and any third party, includ -\ning members of the general public, to report concerns about unethical behavior \nto Citi’s Ethics Office. In addition to inter -\nnal and public-facing websites facilitating the submission of concerns, a telephone line is available 24 hours a day, seven \ndays a week, with live operators who \ncan connect to translators in multiple \nlanguages.\nWe believe it is essential that individuals \nfeel secure when raising a concern. All Spotlight on Ethics \nCiti shares the results of ethics investigations with employees through a quarterly com-\nmunication called the Spotlight on Ethics. This communication is designed to show  \nemployees that their concerns are investigated while highlighting commonplace areas in \nwhich ethical lapses can occur. The Spotlight on Ethics also includes corrective actions \nto demonstrate that speaking up and raising concerns leads to meaningful action. With \ndata security among Citi’s most material environmental, social and governance issues, \n2019 Spotlight communications focused on information security, addressing topics such \nas safeguarding Citi’s network and systems by protecting user IDs and passwords; Citi’s \nprohibition on the use of personal email to conduct Citi business or transmit Citi infor -\nmation; the importance of proper data classification and handling; and the risks posed \nto our network by the downloading of unapproved software and the use of unauthorized \ncode. These communications emphasized that our workforce is on the front line of Citi’s \ninformation security and that each employee has a responsibility to protect and defend \ndata and information entrusted to Citi.  \n117\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \ncontacts and investigations are treated \nas confidentially as possible, consistent \nwith the need to investigate and address \nthe matter and subject to applicable laws \nand regulations. Concerns may be raised \neither anonymously or with attribution, \nsubject to applicable laws and regula -\ntions. Further, Citi prohibits any form of retaliation against anyone who raises a \nconcern or question in good faith or who participates in a subsequent investigation. \nEmployees who engage in retaliation \nagainst a colleague because he or she \nraised a concern or question in good faith, \nasked for a reasonable accommodation, \nreported a violation or was involved in an \ninvestigation are subject to disciplinary \naction, up to and including termination  \nof employment or other relationship  with Citi. \nEach year, the Citi Ethics Office provides \nto all employees a summary of the types \nof concerns received through the Ethics \nHotline, to show the use of Citi’s Ethics \nHotline process and demonstrate that \nraising concerns to the Citi Ethics Office \nleads to meaningful action within our \norganization. Examples of such action \ncan include disciplinary actions against \nindividual employees and nonemployees; the termination of vendor relationships; \nreferrals to the appropriate law enforce -\nment or governmental authorities; communications to our workforce; addi -\ntional training for employees and nonem -\nployees; changes to Citi policy, business \nprocesses and procedures; and control \nenhancements. \nIndustry Collaboration\nWe have made a concerted effort to \npartner with key stakeholders on ways \nthat we can collectively improve the \nculture of the banking industry as well \nas corporate culture overall. In 2019, for \nexample, Citi was one of 181 companies \nwhose chief executive officers signed the \nBusiness Roundtable’s new Statement on \nthe Purpose of a Corporation. As a signa -\ntory, our CEO committed to lead Citi for \nthe benefit of all stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.\nAlso in 2019, Citi’s Chief Innovation \nOfficer and head of Citi Ventures partic -\nipated on a panel at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s annual workshop \non culture and behavior, discussing the \nimpact of new technologies on culture in \nthe workforce. \nCiti is also a member of the Banking \nStandards Board (BSB) in the UK. \nTogether with more than 30 other member firms, we support the BSB’s \nindependent role to help rebuild trust \nand confidence across the UK banking \nindustry by promoting high ethical and \nprofessional standards for behavior and \ncompetence. We remain engaged with \nthe BSB directly through our UK senior \nmanagement. Our Chief Country Officer \nfor the UK has been a BSB board member since its inception. Managing Compliance \nRisk\nOur ICRM team helps to drive a culture of \nethical conduct at Citi by establishing poli -\ncies, programs and procedures that guide and support our employees in making \nethical decisions and adhering to appro -\npriate standards of conduct. Through an integrated compliance risk management \nframework, this group protects Citi by \nsetting standards; providing guidance, \ntraining and advice to our businesses regarding compliance risk; and driving \nownership and accountability for manag -\ning compliance risk in accordance with Citi standards across the firm. Managing \ncompliance risk is the responsibility of \nall of our employees and requires not \nonly adherence to applicable laws, regu -\nlations, policies and relevant standards of conduct but also the promotion of Reinforcing Our Commitment to  \nEthics from the Top\nGlobally, senior Citi leaders have been reinforcing the importance of ethical \ndecision-making. In Mexico, our largest consumer market outside of the U.S., \nand in multiple other countries in Latin America, our senior executives and \ncolleagues engaged in a yearlong campaign to promote ethical decision-making \nand escalation across the organization. Through a senior leadership town hall, \ninternal communications, manager trainings and monthly surveys to validate \nlearning, we worked to foster a collaborative environment in which colleagues \nfeel comfortable talking about ethical dilemmas and asking for advice about \nhow to deal with challenging situations. A similar effort was rolled out in six \ncountries in Asia Pacific, with approximately 7,000 employees participating. Citi Country Officers, who are responsible for leading the business in each \nmarket, and their management teams led interactive, face-to-face workshops \nfor employees. By considering how individuals may be able to rationalize \nunethical behaviors, employees engaged in thought-provoking discussions that \nallowed them to better identify these rationalizations and effectively mitigate \nthem. Similar sessions will be rolled out elsewhere in 2020. The Ethical Fitness \nCampaign, launched at the end of 2019, will help to reinforce these efforts. \n118\nbusiness behavior and activity consistent \nwith the values and conduct expecta -\ntions outlined by our Mission and Value Proposition, Leadership Standards and \nCode of Conduct. Through the work \nof a range of teams focused on Citi’s \nanti-corruption efforts — including Anti-\nBribery, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), \nSanctions and the Ethics Office — we \nwork to counteract the many and varied threats of corruption facing the financial \nsector. Citi’s global Compliance organiza -\ntion is headed by our Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to our CEO \nand provides regular reports on the \nperformance of the compliance program, \nincluding in regard to Anti-Bribery, Anti-\nMoney Laundering and Sanctions, to our \nBoard of Directors or a committee of the Board, as appropriate. \nAnti-Bribery Program \nWe continually enhance our Anti-Bribery Program with respect to the areas \noutlined in the Citi Anti-Bribery Program \nStatement  — which is updated at least annually — and in our Code of Conduct , \nwhich summarizes our Anti-Bribery \nPolicy. \nCiti complies with all applicable anti- \nbribery laws and regulations, including \nthe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, \nthe UK Bribery Act and the applicable \nlocal anti-bribery laws of the countries \nin which we operate. Our Anti-Bribery \nProgram Statement expressly prohibits \nbribery in any form for our employees, as \nwell as our suppliers. \nWe have written policies, procedures \nand internal controls designed to comply with anti-bribery laws. We conduct an \nannual bribery risk assessment of all \nglobal business lines. The risk assessment \naddresses many areas of risk, including \ngifts and entertainment, hiring practices \nand third-party relationships.  \nWe provide our staff with anti-bribery \ntraining annually and supplement it with \ntargeted training and communications \nas needed. We give staff multiple ways, \nincluding the Ethics Hotline, to escalate bribery-related concerns and to prompt investigations, where necessary. \nSanctions Program\nCiti conducts business and operations in compliance with applicable sanctions, \nlaws and regulations, including those of \nthe U.S. and other countries in which we \noperate. We maintain a robust, risk-based \nICRM Sanctions Program that applies \nglobally and is commensurate with our \nglobal footprint. As a financial institution \norganized in the U.S., Citi and our subsid -\niaries globally comply with applicable U.S. \nsanctions requirements, among other \nrequirements. \nOur enterprise-wide Sanctions Program \npromotes compliance with increasingly \ndynamic sanctions requirements. The \nprogram includes policies and proce -\ndures, risk category statement and tolerance thresholds, enterprise-wide \nscreening, annual risk assessments and \naudits of sanctions control processes, \nemployee training and a diverse team of Compliance professionals stationed \naround the world.  \nAnti-Money Laundering \nProgram\nCiti’s AML Program works to protect \nour clients, our franchise and the global \nfinancial system from the risks of money \nlaundering and terrorist financing. \nThe program centers on: \n •Prevention:  Citi’s Global Know Your \nCustomer Program is the cornerstone \nof our AML Program, enabling us \nto effectively evaluate the potential \nrisks associated with each client \nrelationship and ensure that we \nadhere to globally consistent policies \nand standards, customer risk scoring \nand onboarding. \n Leadership Standards Accountability\nOur culture is not just who we are and what we believe; it’s how we act in small, \neveryday moments. We encourage all employees to demonstrate the behaviors of our \nLeadership Standards, which are the measurable skills, abilities and knowledge that \nall of us at Citi should exhibit to be successful leaders. Holding ourselves and each \nother to these high standards is part of our culture and our commitment to operating \nin our clients’ best interests, driving economic value and minimizing risk. \nWe expect managers to lead by example and inspire their employees to live Citi’s val-\nues. Every manager is responsible for creating a work environment free of discrimina-\ntion, harassment and retaliation. As role models, managers reinforce the importance \nof following our Leadership Standards, Code of Conduct and Mission and Value Propo-\nsition, as well as encourage employees to raise any concerns about potential legal \nor ethical issues. Managers also ensure concerns are properly resolved or promptly escalated through appropriate channels, promote awareness of all resources available \nfor reporting concerns and neither engage in nor tolerate retaliation of any kind. \n119\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \n •Detection:  We monitor transactions \nto identify unusual or suspicious \ntransactions, behaviors or patterns \nof activity across our global footprint. \nOur AML investigations unit reviews \ntransactions of new and existing cli -\nents across businesses and regions.  \n •Reporting:  We create, track and \nfile Suspicious Activity Reports, \nSuspicious Transaction Reports and \nCurrency Transaction Reports, as \nrequired in many countries.  \n •Governance: Our enterprise-wide \ncontrols that govern the overall \nprogram include global AML policies, \nprocesses, testing and training. Citi’s \nGlobal AML Program Head and Bank \nSecrecy Act Officer is responsible for \noverseeing the program, including \napprising the Board of Directors and \nsenior management of AML initia -\ntives, any significant deficiencies and \nthe reporting of suspicious activity. \nOur AML Program includes more than \n5,700 employees globally, including \nmore than 490 designated AML Officers \ncovering every Citi business, function \nand geographic area. These specialists partner with various functions, including \nCompliance, Audit, Technology, and our \ninstitutional and consumer businesses, \nto provide effective enterprise AML risk \nassessment and to meet our AML -related requirements at both the global and local levels. In 2019, we merged our AML and \nICRM teams to form one organization \nthat encourages a culture of compliance, \nrisk management and control across the \ncompany. For more information on Citi’s \nAML Program, visit our website .\nCiti Korea Sets High Bar  \nfor AML\nEvery year, the Korean government and \nKorea Financial Intelligence Unit recognize  \na financial institution for its outstanding contributions to enhancing AML pro-\ngrams.

Citi was recognized \nfor establishing a dedicated AML moni-\ntoring team and introducing a risk-based \napproach to maintain high standards in regulatory reporting. Combating the Illegal \nWildlife Trade\nFinancial institutions play a critical \nrole in disrupting the flow of income \ngenerated by illegal wildlife traffick -\ning (IWT). Citi is a member of United for Wildlife’s Financial Taskforce, \na collaboration between financial \ninstitutions and NGOs to fight IWT, \nwhich is a multibillion-dollar global \ncriminal enterprise. Throughout \n2019, we issued a series of internal publications focused on IWT — \nespecially regarding elephants, \nrhinos and pangolins — to increase \nawareness, identify red flags and \nenhance our AML program at \nmultiple touchpoints, including \nclient onboarding, transactional \nreview and investigations. We also \nshared these red flags with relevant clients to help them identify IWT. \nIn addition, Citi worked closely with \nThe Royal Foundation and other \nfinancial institutions to develop a \nlong-term strategic plan to mobilize \nthe Financial Taskforce and develop \ngoals for 2020 and beyond. \n120\nNumber of Employees Who Completed Citi’s 2019 Anti-Money \nLaundering, Sanctions and Anti-Bribery Training (By Region)* \n*  T his combined online training incorporates multiple anti-corruption efforts, including AML, sanctions and anti-  \nbribery training.

The episode sent a clear message that \nbanks working with embassies had to get serious about implementing strong anti-money laundering controls. \nTraditionally, embassies have executed \npayments independently and with limited oversight from a central governing body, allowing embassy officials to make indi -\nvidual transaction decisions. This oper -\nating model leads to banks establishing numerous relationships with separate entities around the world, making it more challenging to Know Your Customer (KYC), a regulatory requirement that mandates that banks understand their clients, obtain detailed information about them and their intended activity, and ensure that services are not being used for illegal activities. Citi developed an approach allowing embassy clients to utilize existing central -\nized cash management platforms to execute payments that enhanced oversight and transparency by their home govern -\nments, rather than operating independently or extensively with cash at the local level. Implementing these tools mitigates the risk posed by our embassy clients, reduces the administrative burden on KYC owners around KYC periodic reviews and improves the overall client experience. For our clients, the new approach meant greater transparency and reduced operat -\ning costs. Australia, for example, previously bought currency locally and sent it to its foreign embassies to manage. After the implementation of new tools from Citi, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade gained the ability to see every one of its bank accounts and payments around the world, aggregated on a single platform. \n121\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nServing Our \nCustomers and  Clients Responsibly\nWe have policies and systems in place to \nmake sure we are always treating custom -\ners responsibly and fairly, as reflected in our Code of Conduct and our internal \nchecks-and-balances processes when \ncreating new products.\nResponsible Marketing \nWe are committed to providing clients with the right products and services \nbased on their needs, wants and pref -\nerences, while adhering to all internal policies and procedures as well as all \nbanking laws and regulations.

We \naim to deliver products and services that \nprovide value, clarity and dependability, \nguided by the TCF principles that define \nour standards for our products and services. \nThe Global Consumer Fairness Policy \nprovides a framework for reviewing \nconsumer fairness concerns and \na sustainable model for managing \nCiti’s Treating Customers Fairly \nPrinciples\n \n1) Works as described \nConsumers can predict how products and \nservices will work.\n2) Appropriate \nConsumers can rely on Citi to offer  \nappropriate products and services that meet their needs.\n3) Value \nConsumers receive value that is reason-\nably related to the cost of the products \nand services.\n4) Ease of Understanding  \nConsumers understand the terms and \nconditions of the products and services \n(particularly limitations and exclusions).\n122\nemerging risks. The policy covers all \naspects of the consumer product and \nservices lifecycle, including new product \ndevelopment, marketing, sales (includ -\ning variable incentive compensation), underwriting and onboarding as well as \nall other stages. There are established, \nformalized escalation processes to \nBusiness Practices Committees that \nfacilitate consistent, timely and appropri -\nate identification, analysis and escalation \nof potential consumer fairness and \nreputational and franchise risk issues. In \nrelation to designing variable incentive \nplans, we consider a number of factors, \nincluding whether plans align with our \nTCF principles. For example, we leverage \nclient satisfaction metrics, where avail -\nable, along with other product-based \nmetrics, to incentivize achieving business \nresults that adhere to internal policies \nand our Code of Conduct. We routinely \nevaluate incentive plans, training content, \ncontrols, monitoring and oversight in \norder to maintain a sales force that \ndelivers on Citi’s commitment to serving \nour customers with fairness, value, clarity \nand dependability.  As part of the program, Global Consumer Banking employees are required to \ncomplete annual TCF training to ensure \nthey understand how to identify issues \nof fairness and how fairness influences \nreal-world results. In 2019, more than \n90,000 Citi employees around the world \ncompleted the course. We also have a \nrange of measures in place to monitor \nsales practices, including auditing, mystery shopping and suitability metrics \nthat assess client risk profiles against \nthe risk profile of the investment. When \nappropriate, we proactively contact \ndelinquent clients, basing the time and \nfrequency on their credit risk profile \nand previous payment performance. We \nensure that all contact strategies are \neffectively vetted for privacy and fairness considerations before implementation.\nIn the U.S., fair lending practices are a \nkey component of our commitment to \ntreating customers fairly. Our U.S. Fair \nLending Policy establishes the guiding \nprinciples and minimum standards for \nfair, equitable and nondiscriminatory \naccess to credit. Further, it prohibits discrimination against actual or prospec -\ntive clients on the basis of race, sex \n(which encompasses gender as well as \nsexual orientation and gender identity), \nreligion, disability or other prohibited \nfactors. This commitment is backed \nby training, processes, controls and \noversight to prevent discrimination and \nminimize disparate impact. \nTrue to our commitment to responsible \nfinance, we also hold an annual Fair and \nInclusive Banking Offsite with senior \nmanagement from across the company \nto deepen their understanding of fair \nlending and accessibility. Building \non efforts at the 2018 offsite, during \nwhich our CEO challenged participants \nto outsmart their unconscious biases, participants in 2019 learned from leading \ninternal and external experts how to \nembed inclusion and protection from \ndiscrimination into current strategic \npriorities.  \nAs the external environment and our \nbusiness strategies continue to evolve, \nwe work to continue to update our \n123\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \nunderstanding of key discrimination risks \nand our approach to preventing discrimi -\nnation risks in our business strategies, as well as in our product and service design \nand delivery. \nTaxation Policies  \nand Standards \nCiti operates in nearly 100 countries \nand strictly abides by all tax laws in the \nU.S. and throughout the world. We are a \ncurrent income taxpayer, both within and \noutside the U.S. Our tax profile is consis -\ntent with the locations of our business operations, and our review and escalation \nprocesses enable us to adhere to high \nstandards of compliance with applicable \ntax laws. \nWe emphasize strong internal controls \nand transparency with global tax authori -\nties and share information relevant to our \ntax profile. We supplement this transpar -\nency with additional country-by-country reporting, which is required under the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development’s action plan to address \nbase erosion and profit shifting. Our \ntax policy is overseen by our Chief Tax \nOfficer, who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Tax policies and related matters \nare reviewed by the Audit Committee of \nthe Board of Directors. \nCiti complies with reporting and with -\nholding requirements imposed globally \non financial institutions in connection \nwith customer transactions that these \ninstitutions intermediate. We have imple -\nmented systems and processes to comply with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance \nAct, and we are in compliance with the Common Reporting Standard in all appli -\ncable countries where local implementing guidance has been issued. Similarly, we \nhave a firm-wide policy applicable to customer transactions under which Citi \nwill only engage in a transaction where \nthere is a high degree of certainty that \nany tax aspects will be accepted by the \nrespective taxing authorities. \nBeginning in 2018, the Tax Cuts and \nJobs Act of 2017 fundamentally changed \nthe method of taxation of international income earned by Citi. We continue to \napply the same consistent, transparent \nand responsible approach to tax compli -\nance and governance outlined in this report. For more information on how \ntaxation impacts Citi, see page 113 of our \n2019 Form 10-K . \nPublic Policy \nWe engage directly, and indirectly through trade associations, with govern -\nments and elected officials around the world to advocate for public policies that \nsupport the interests of our company, \nclients and employees in the countries \nand regions where we operate. Guided by \nour Political Activities Statement , which \nensures compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, we promote policies and positions on issues such as trade, \ncybersecurity, data localization, tax \nand financial reforms. Our Government \nAffairs team members complete annual \ncompliance training, conducted by \noutside experts, on campaign finance, \nlobbying and gifts/entertainment rules. \nUnder U.S. Federal Election Commission \nrules, Citi’s Political Action Committee \npools the voluntary contributions of eligi -\nble employees to support U.S. political \ncandidates and campaigns that support \nthe financial industry and complemen -\ntary pro-business policies. This support allows us to take an active role in our \ncountry’s political process, promote our \nbusiness goals and strengthen relation -\nships with U.S. policymakers. Annually, we disclose our U.S. political contri -\nbutions on our Corporate Governance \nwebpage . That page also includes \nextensive disclosure about our practices pertaining to political contributions and \nlobbying activities, as well as a regularly \nupdated list of our significant trade and \nbusiness associations. Our disclosures \nand contributions are overseen by the \nNomination, Governance and Public Affairs Committee of our Board of \nDirectors. \nWhat’s Ahead\nAs consumers remain distrustful of insti -\ntutions in the wake of breaches of trust in numerous sectors, including banking, we \nmust stay ever-vigilant to ensure we act \nwith integrity and transparency in all that \nwe do. This commitment starts at the top, \nand we will continue to focus on engag -\ning senior executives to reinforce the importance of ethics and transparency \nfor all employees. We will also continue to collaborate with others in our industry \nand beyond to address ethical and risk \nissues, such as illegal wildlife trafficking \nand bias in marketing.\n124\nAPPENDICESPage 126   2019 Sustainable Progress  \nStrategy Scorecard\nPage 128  GRI Content Index\nPage 142   Task Force on Climate-related  \nFinancial Disclosures Index\nPage 143   United Nations Global Compact  \nIndex\nPage 145   United Nations Guiding Principles \nReporting Framework Index\nPage 149  Assurance\n125Citi 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \n2019 Sustainable Progress Strategy Scorecard \nEnvironmental Finance \nOur $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal: To finance and facilitate $100 billion over 10 years  \ntoward activities that reduce the impacts of climate change and create environmental solutions\nGoal Metric By 2019 Progress\nEnvironmental  \nfinance goal$100 billion in environmental finance activity 2023 $164B\nEnvironmental  \nimpact tracking*Total avoided GHG emissions 11.7M (mt)\nSocial impact  \ntracking*Jobs supported by renewable energy project finance and public finance activity  \n(includes direct, indirect and induced jobs)198K jobs\nAnnual riders on transit system projects 18.2B rides\nPeople serviced by water-quality projects 95M people\nFamilies serviced by affordable housing activity 6.7K\nEnvironmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM)\nManage environmental and social risks and impacts associated with client transactions and our  \nfinancial products and services\nGoal 2019 Progress\nESRM Policy  \ncontinuous improvements• Implemented global coal-fired power Sector Standard; declined project-related financing for new coal capacity\n• Updated and expanded ESRM due diligence under coal mining Sector Standard \nInternal  \ntraining• Trained more than 600 employees on ESRM policies and procedures through a combination of classroom and \nvirtual trainings\n• Integrated climate risk information into ESRM Policy trainings\nPortfolio-level \nanalysis of  high-risk sectors• Conducted portfolio review of power clients’ GHG reporting, targets and low-carbon transition plans\n• Developed climate-related risk questionnaire for carbon-intensive sectors\n• Conducted agribusiness portfolio review to understand best practices for managing deforestation risk\nMonitoring  \nof emerging  risks and trends• Tracked climate risk developments through engagement with regulators, clients and other stakeholders\n• Advised bankers and clients on emerging sustainable finance products, such as green bonds and sustainability \nlinked loans, as well as evolving market criteria and expectations regarding the structure of these products\nBuilding global \ncapacity• Collaborated with approximately 40 banks in the second phase of the UNEP FI TCFD pilot project to enhance \nthe methodologies, tools and scenarios for assessing the potential financial impacts of transition and physical \nclimate risks on bank loan portfolios\n• Co-led biodiversity working group of the Equator Principles (EP) Association, which led to a new EP requirement \nto promote increased biodiversity data sharing as part of project environmental assessments* These potential impacts represent the estimated positive environmental and social benefits of a subset of our environmental finance transactions.\n126\nOperations \nMinimize our impacts across Citi’s entire portfolio of 7,700 owned and leased facilities\nGoal Metric By 2019 Progress\nEnvironmental  \nfootprint100% use of renewable electricity  \nfor facilities globally*2020 86%\n30% reduction in energy consumption (compared with 2005 baseline)2020 35%\n30% reduction in water consumption (compared with 2005 baseline)2020 35%\n10% of water used coming from reclaimed or recycled sources2020 6%\n60% diversion rate of waste to landfill \n(compared with 2005 baseline)2020 63%\n33% of global real estate portfolio LEED-certified2020 27%\n \nSupply Chain \nWork with our suppliers to ensure that they meet high environmental and social standards\nGoal Metric By 2019 Progress\nEstablish supply chain policies:\n• Paper and paper products\n• IT hardware and e-waste disposal\n• Travel and logisticsPolicies finalized and \nimplemented2019 • Sustainable supply chain policies have been drafted and discussed internally.

The scope of the assurance, based on the SGS Sustainability Report Assurance methodology, \nincluded the data in accompanying tables, contained in this report.  \n The information in the “Citi’s 2019 Environmental, Social and Governance  Report” of Citigroup Inc. and \nits presentation are the responsibility of the directors and the management of Citigroup Inc. SGS has not \nbeen involved in the preparation of any of the material included in the “C iti’s 2019 Environmental, Social \nand Governance  Report”.

This \nstandard follows differing options for Assurance depending on the context and capabilities of the Reporting \nOrganization. This report has been assured at a limited level of scrutiny using our protocols for evaluation \nof content veracity and the alignment to the Equator Principles III and the internal policies and procedures of Citigroup Inc.  \n The assurance comprised a combination of pre -assurance research, interviews with rele vant employees; \ndocumentation and record review and the evaluation of the report for the alignment to the Equator \nPrinciples III.  \n \nSTATEMENT OF INDEPENDENCE AND COMPETENCE \nThe SGS Group of companies is the world leader in inspection, testing and verificati on, operating in more \nthan 140 countries and providing services including management systems and service certification; \nquality, environmental, social and ethical auditing; sustainability report assurance and greenhouse gases \nverification.

SGS based this opinion in the review of Citi’s internal documents, including guides, standards, \nprocedures, manuals, spreadsheets, and a sample of EP -covered financial products and their respe ctive \nEP checklists and Independent Reviews.  \n \nCitigroup Inc. reported information is aligned to the EP Reporting Criteria requirements as follows:  \n \n• Public Reporting of the EP -covered  financial products separately: Project Finance Advisory \nServices, Project Finance Loans, Project -Related Corporate Loans and  Bridge Loans  \n• The loans were categorized as A, B or C, dependent on the environmental and social risks posed.   \n• Total number of Project Finance  Loans and Project -Related Corporate Loans that reached \nFinancial Close during the reporting period (2019)  \n• The Project Finance Loans and Project -Related Corporate Loans were broken down by: Sector, \nRegion, Country Designation, and whether an Independent Review has  been carried out or not.  \n• Independent review is required for A projects and, for B projects when needed. There was only \none project category A  and the Independent Review was provided. Some  of the projects category \nB also had an Independent Review conducted . \n• The EP transactions were over the threshold of 10 million USD for the Project Capital Cost required in the Equator Principles III for project finance loans, and over 100 million USD for \nProject-Related Corporate Loans . \n \n \nSigned: \nFor and on behalf of SGS  \n \n \n Ursula Antunez de Mayolo Corzo \nSGS Lead Sustainability Report Assuror  \n03\nrd April , 2020 \nwww.sgs.com  \n155\nCiti 2019 ESG ReportContents   Our Approach to ESG   Solutions for Impact   How We Do Business   Appendices              \n© 2020 Citigroup Inc.  \nCiti, Citi with Arc Design and Citibank are trademarks and servicemarks of Citigroup Inc. \n(and its affiliates) and are used and registered throughout the world.","index":5},{"0":"rbc","1":"https://www.rbc.com/community-social-impact/_assets-custom/pdf/2019-ESG-Report.PDF","2":"2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  1 \nHNW_NRG_B_Bleed_NoMask\nRoyal Bank of Canada\nEnvironment, Social  \nand Governance (ESG)\nPerformance Report 2019\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  2 Caution regarding forward-looking statements \nFrom time to time, we make written or oral forward-looking statements \nwithin the meaning of certain securities laws, including the “safe \nharbour” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation \nReform Act of 1995 and any applicable Canadian securities legislation. \nWe may make forward-looking statements in this 2019 Environmental, \nSocial and Governance (ESG) Performance Report, in filings with \nCanadian regulators or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC), in reports to shareholders and in other communications.

The RBC Climate Blueprint is \ndesigned to guide us, working with our clients and communities, to contribute to \na healthier planet and more prosperous economy for the 21st century. Because \nwe believe it’s the smart choice.\nClimate change is one of the most pressing issues of our age – and the financial \nsystem needs to be leading efforts to support clean economic growth and the \ntransition to the low-carbon economy. Climate change is already a business \nreality for our clients, and many have embraced new ways of doing business and \nreframed climate action as an opportunity to improve and expand what they do.\nWe believe that capital can be a force for positive change, clearly demonstrated  \nby a new business target: $100 billion in sustainable financing by 2025. This \ngoal supports investments in sustainable companies and projects that are \nwidely recognized as contributing to the low-carbon, sustainable economy of \nthe future.\nWe aspire to help the world meet its energy needs and move to increasingly \ncleaner fuel sources. We are balancing our commitment to sustainable \nfinancing with investments in our energy and natural resource clients so they \ncan continue to invest in innovation and technologies that help them reduce \nemissions and remain leaders on the global stage.  \nThis approach to sustainability is central to our business and to our stated \nPurpose, which is to help clients thrive and communities prosper. We know \nwe can do this by taking the best of what we have today - of our human \nresources and natural resources – to build a better tomorrow. The choice \nbelongs to all of us.\nDavid McKay\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Bank of Canada\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  4 \nCEO Message\n“On any journey, we can only move \nforward when we know where we \nstand and what we stand for.”\nThe technological revolution sweeping the world is a key driver of \neconomic growth. It is also a major source of disruption.\nIts promise and peril are evident in the communities where we live  \nand work.\nFor example, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are being \ndeployed for good to address complex environmental challenges,  \nand help individuals find new career pathways. Yet many of the same \ntechnologies are being used to harm institutions and individuals alike \nthrough cyber theft. In other cases, they are automating work, and \neliminating jobs.  \nWhile we at RBC are optimistic about the future, we are also in a privileged \nposition to help those we serve – and our society at large – be better \nprepared for it. To us, that’s what being Purpose-led is all about: we strive \nto help clients thrive and communities prosper. \nThis report reveals many of the ways we lived up to our Purpose in fiscal \n2019. It highlights how our $130 million of donations and community \ninvestments were put to work. And it speaks to the kind of bold convictions \nand commitments we make to deliver positive outcomes and create the \nmost value for those we serve.On these pages, you will find our actions underpinned in the following  \nfive ways:\nWe evaluate our performance in ways that go beyond \nfinancial results. \nThis includes our time and resources to help employees grow, develop and \nachieve their career aspirations. We work hard to create meaningful value \nfor our clients, which goes beyond traditional banking services. And we \nlook for ways to help prepare RBC employees, and youth, for the future  \nof work. This balanced scorecard approach has been part of our DNA  \nfor decades. \nOur size and scale provide us with huge advantages, \nincluding our ability to advance the public interest. \nNone is more pressing than climate change. RBC’s unique role enables us \nto support clean economic growth in a number of ways. In 2019, as part of \nour Climate Blueprint, we announced a new business target of $100 billion \nin sustainable financing by 2025. This goal supports investments in \ncompanies and projects that are widely recognized as contributing to the \nlow-carbon, sustainable economy of the future.\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  5 We speak up on matters to help make our communities \nhealthier, more prosperous and inclusive. \nA disruptive age often breeds divisive rhetoric. In 2019, around the world, \nwe heard political leaders fan the flames of nationalism and \nprotectionism. In our view, a splintering society is not a sustainable one. \nIt’s a big reason why we are a strong advocate for inclusion. \nIn 2019, we invited people from all walks of life to have a frank \nconversation about prevalent misperceptions on gender, race, religion, \nsexual orientation and ability. Our “Speak Up for Inclusion” video \ngenerated widespread attention on social media and, more importantly, \nextended the dialogue on an issue that has a direct impact on our \neconomic and social well-being. We will expand on our efforts in 2020. \nRBC forms strategic partnerships to make  \na greater impact. \nOrganizations must operate with humility, understanding they cannot be \neverything to everyone. Creating meaningful value requires partnerships \nbetween like-minded organizations, whose competencies complement \neach other and, when combined, elevate any given offering. Consider one \nway we are looking to manage cyber risk. We partnered with government, \nacademia, law enforcement and other businesses to establish a Canadian \nhub to strengthen the talent pool required to keep our citizens safe from \npotential threats. \nAnd in helping Canadian youth prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, in 2019, \nthe RBC Future Launch® initiative expanded its national network of \ncharitable partners to 435, increasing the number of people who benefit \nfrom these high-impact programs. Indeed, close to two million youth \nparticipated in RBC Future Launch®. Feedback has been positive and  \nthe overwhelming majority of participants now feel better prepared for  \nthe future. Dave McKay\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Bank of CanadaCEO Message\nWe take ownership for our actions. \nOn any journey, we can only move forward when we know where we stand \nand what we stand for. Consider our efforts to become one of the most \ndiverse and inclusive workplaces. Tracking representation is one \nimportant way to hold ourselves accountable. Importantly, this year, we \nbegan sharing quarterly diversity and inclusion performance updates with \nall RBC employees so they remain informed and engaged in our journey. \nBut we know that’s not enough. That’s why we are also committed to \nbuilding inclusion by understanding different experiences and viewpoints \nfrom our employees that enable our people to perform at their  \nhighest level. \nTimes of transformation are always a test of leadership. For us, it’s \nimportant to remain present and purposeful in the communities where we \nlive and work. That’s because RBC is on the same journey, inspired by \nsimilar aspirations, guided by common goals. RBC is, and will continue to \nbe, a positive force in the lives of those we serve. By doing so we will help \nmaximize the benefits and minimize the risks in a world of change  \nand disruption.\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  6 Scope\nThis Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Performance Report (the “Report”) includes information about Royal Bank of Canada and its \nsubsidiaries (referred to as \"RBC\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\" in this Report) and excludes information about City National Bank (City National), unless otherwise \nnoted.

Our disclosure focuses \non our ESG priorities as well as the metrics and targets we \nuse to measure our performance in these areas. \nGovernance & Integrity\nValue for SocietyValue for ClientsValue for Employees\nValue for PlanetLegend\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  10 How we identify our ESG priorities \nEach year we conduct a review of the ESG factors that matter most to our \nstakeholders and that have a potential financial or reputational impact on \nRBC. Beyond this, we also regularly analyze stakeholder feedback, \nindustry trends and independent research. \nIdentifying ESG priorities aligns with our enterprise risk appetite, which is \nto ensure we identify and manage the top and emerging risks, as disclosed \nin our 2019 Annual Report , and incorporate them into our existing risk \nmanagement assessment, measurement, monitoring and escalation \nprocesses. This requires management to conduct a forward-looking \nassessment of risks to the organization.\nIn 2019, we conducted a review of our stated ESG priorities, comparing \nthem to the disclosure requirements of key ESG rating agencies, and to the \nareas of interest expressed to us by stakeholders throughout the year. We \nexamined how rating agencies assessed financial institutions (FIs), which \nESG factors they considered most relevant and what year-on-year changes \nthey made to the weightings assigned to each ESG factor. For example, we \nfound that rating agencies increased the weighting of the scores for \nclimate change and sustainable finance in 2019. \nFollowing our internal review, we commissioned Deloitte to review and \nvalidate our understanding and ranking of our ESG priorities. The \nvalidation included benchmarking against our Canadian and global peers \nto identify leading practices and emerging trends in identifying ESG \npriorities, and in engaging and communicating with stakeholders. As a \nresult of their assessment, we updated our matrix of ESG priorities to \nshow the increased importance of climate change (because of increased \nstakeholder interest and its impact on the business) and the banking \nindustry’s growing focus on how workforce practices, data privacy and \ncyber security can impact our business. Continuously improving our ESG disclosure\nWe currently engage with investors on ESG priorities, and we will continue \nto do this in fiscal 2020, which will inform our disclosure next year. In \naddition, we plan to further enhance our engagement approach on our \nESG disclosure with internal and external stakeholders in fiscal 2020.  \nWe aim to increase our transparency and disclosure on how we manage \nour ESG priorities by increasing engagement and collaboration with \ninternal teams and business leaders. Our approach is to continuously \nimprove, with a focus on 1) disclosing the most relevant performance \nmetrics and 2) embracing the principles and guidance of prevailing ESG \nreporting standards, including those associated with the SASB, GRI, IIRC, \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial \nStability Board (FSB), as well as local and national regulations in the \nregions where we operate. We invite our stakeholders to provide feedback \non our disclosure by sending an email to corporatecitizenship@rbc.com .Our ESG priorities\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  11 Performance metrics Targets 2019 2018 2017\nOverall – ESG Composite Index2é 81 81 79\nGovernance & Integrity\nPercentage of independent directors3Substantial majority 92% 92% 92%\nPercentage of women directors4>30% 43% 38% 38%\nPercentage of women executives548% 46% 45% 44%\nPercentage of visible minority executives5,619% 19% 20% 17%\nValue for Employees\nEmployee Engagement Index score7>82 86 86 85\nDiversity and Inclusion (D&I) Index score8é 87 86 85\nPercentage of women in middle management and above – 45% 45% 45%\nPercentage of visible minorities in middle management and above6– 39% 38% 36%\nPercentage of positions filled by internal candidates N/A 67% 64% 69%\nTotal voluntary turnover rate9– 9.3% 9.5% 9.1%\nTotal turnover rate9– 12.4% 12.6% 13.1%\nAbsentee rate (percentage of total days scheduled)10ê 1.05% 1.09% 1.15%\nValue for Clients\nClient Experience score11é 60.6 59.4 56.9\nRelationship share12>12%4818% 21% 23%\nPercentage of financial service transactions performed in  \nself-serve channels13 é 88% 86% 84%\n90-day digital active user rate14é 52% 50% 47%\nTotal value of socially responsible investments (SRI) and Impact assets \nunder management by RBC companies15 é $7.7 billion $7.0 billion $5.8 billion\nTotal value of sustainable finance $100 billion by 2025 $25.9 billion N/A N/Aa\na\na\na\na\na\na\na\naStatement of Performance\n\té Target associated with continuous improvement over prior year or three-year rolling average.\n N/A Targets or performance metrics are not applicable.\n –   We do not currently have targets associated with these performance metrics.

In 2019, as part of our annual Employee Opinion Survey (EOS), 92% of our employees \nindicated that they felt they were treated with respect. This is an example of the strong and consistent response to key EOS questions that reflect our risk \nconduct and culture. We are confident that overall our workplaces are healthy and our workforce is engaged. \nThe RBC Leadership Model, which sets out key behaviours expected of our workforce, encourages speaking up for the good of RBC, and our Code of \nConduct requires all employees to report misconduct. Employees are encouraged to speak to their manager, Human Resources manager or Compliance \nso their issues are resolved quickly and objectively. However, other channels are available if they are not comfortable with these ones.   \nOn April 30, 2019, we introduced our global Conduct Hotline. This is a confidential channel for all employees to report misconduct. A third party \nindependent of RBC administers the Conduct Hotline, and employees can use it to report and track the status of their report anonymously. The Conduct \nHotline has received 185 reports since its launch in April (as at the end of fiscal 2019). \nRBC is committed to ensuring employees have a fair and transparent experience in having their concerns heard and addressed in accordance with our \nValues. Investigations are conducted as appropriate by trained professionals in Human Resources, Compliance, the Law Group, Privacy/Information \nSecurity, Internal Audit and Corporate Investigation Services or independent, external investigators. In addition to addressing misconduct, we \nproactively take note of any learnings from the investigations and make recommendations, as appropriate, to enhance our workplace. \nRBC is committed to protecting employees from retaliation when they raise concerns. We actively monitor for retaliation including by following up with \nemployees after an investigation is closed, and annually reviewing key indicators such as performance ratings, compensation and employment status. All \npeople managers are accountable for protecting employees who raise concerns about retaliation, and any retaliation is treated as a breach of our Code \nof Conduct.Conduct and trust\n2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  20 Tax\nOur Audit Committee oversees our financial reporting including our tax reporting. We discuss our tax position with the Audit Committee on a regular basis \nand our tax strategy with the Audit and Risk Committees.\nOur approach to taxation is grounded in principles that are reflected in our Code of Conduct, is governed by our Enterprise Tax Risk Management Policy \nand incorporates the fundamentals of our risk drivers. Group Executives, including the chief financial officer (CFO) and the senior vice-president of \nTaxation, oversee the taxation policy and manage tax risk.  \nWith operations in 36 countries, we are subject to Canadian and international tax legislation and other regulations, and our activities are fully disclosed  \nto the relevant tax authorities. 85% of our revenue is earned in Canada and the United States and we provide tax information for this geography in our \npublished financial statements. In addition, we provide tax information annually on a country-by-country basis to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). \nTaxation and Group Risk Management (GRM) regularly review the activities of RBC and its subsidiaries to ensure we are compliant with tax and  \nother regulations. \nWe commit to:\n¡   Acting with integrity and in a straightforward, open and honest manner \nin all tax matters\n¡   Ensuring our tax strategy aligns with our business strategy, supporting \nonly bona fide transactions with a business purpose and economic \nsubstance\n¡   Ensuring we are compliant with tax authorities and providing full \ndisclosure pursuant to our statutory obligations to them¡   Ensuring all inter-company transactions are conducted at arm’s length\n¡   Endeavouring to work with tax authorities to build positive long-term \nrelationships and, where disputes occur, address them constructively Conduct and trust\n2019 Highlights\n¡   Continuously enhancing the control environment with coherent risk \nframeworks, practical policies, guiding principles and procedures\n¡   Establishing a zero-tolerance position on tax evasion and raising \nawareness of this position with: \n   –   Our employees:  Through training and courses on the RBC Code of \nConduct, risk framework, and tax policies and procedures. Employees \nare required to report possible instances of tax avoidance by following \nthe Suspicious Activity Reporting procedures. An independent internal \nConduct Hotline was created in 2019.    –   Our suppliers and service providers:  Since 2018, the Supplier Code of \nConduct has explicitly communicated our expectation of suppliers’ \nown tax compliance.   \n   –   Our customers:  There is a statement on our tax risk approach in our \nAnnual Report as well in our U.K. Tax Strategy Statement . The latter is \npart of our continued commitment to comply with the Code of Practice \non Taxation for Banks. These statements spell out our zero tolerance \nfor client transactions that are pursued to evade tax obligations. We manage tax risk by:\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  21   Risk management\nAs a financial services company, we are in the business of managing risks as we aim to create maximum value for \nour shareholders, clients, employees and communities. The ability to manage risk is one of our core competencies, \nand is supported by our strong conduct and risk culture and an effective risk management approach.\nEnvironmental and social (E&S) risk is the risk that an environmental or social issue associated with a client, \ntransaction, product, supplier or activity will lead to operational, legal, reputational or other risks, or increase the \nrisk of financial losses.

RBC is continuing to \nprovide flexible talent practices that enable us to better attract, develop and retain digital talent with modern and personalized learning paths. In 2019, \nnearly 700 digital roles were filled at RBC with a 95% external job-offer acceptance rate.\nEarly talent\nInvesting in youth is a win-win. Through our learning opportunities, young people can develop the skills they need to succeed in today’s economy,  \nand bring fresh perspectives to drive innovation. We hire over 3,00030 students from 100 colleges and universities every year. In 2019, 40% of the students \nwere women and 47% were visible minorities. We continue to diversify our student population: in 2019, 50% were first and second year students and 50% \nwere third and fourth year students. Technology & Operations’ summer cohort was 41% women in 2019 – compared to 23% in 2018.  \nExceptional work-integrated learning experiences\nWe are enabling graduates and early talent to gain meaningful work experience through diverse placements that develop their skills and help launch their \ncareers. Some examples are:\n¡   RBC Career Launch Program: An annual one-year paid internship was \nawarded to 100 recent college and university graduates. Since its inception \nin 2014, the program has helped over 500 alumni across eight provinces, of \nwhich 54% were women and 50% were visible minorities. As a result of the \nprogram, 89% felt the experience they gained in the program increased \ntheir confidence, and 84% felt they had gained valuable skills that are \nhelping them succeed today. Our most recent graduating class achieved  \nan 85% employment rate after participation in the program.\n¡   RBC Indigenous Peoples Development program:  This two-year rotational \nprogram enables recent graduates to develop the skills and network \nneeded to build up their professional experience. 13 individuals were hired \nthrough this program.¡   RBC Analyst program:  Initially introduced in 2013 as an undergraduate \nrecruitment program for Personal & Commercial Banking supporting \nfunctions, we’ve now expanded it to RBC Ventures Inc., and the program \nreceives 1,000+ applicants annually. Nine individuals were hired through \nthis program.\n¡   RBC Amplify®: This intensive summer innovation program puts students’ \nskills to the test by asking participants to solve business problems, build \nsolutions and pitch products throughout the summer. In 2019, the \n84-person cohort across 21 different RBC teams filed 15 provisional \npatents.Building and attracting talent\n2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  26 Targeted talent strategies\nOur talent strategy focuses on acquiring, developing and retaining talent with the right capabilities needed to execute our business strategy. Our \nworkforce mix – employees and contract workers – is an important aspect of our talent strategy. The rise of the “gig” economy, characterized by short-\nterm contract work, has been well documented. Where work is short-term, either driven by a temporary surge in demand or a temporary need for highly \nspecialized skills, we may contract talent for the flexibility or deep expertise they provide. We have robust policies and processes that limit the \nengagement of contract or temporary workers to certain work only and for limited timeframes, and ensure they are compensated in line with our \ncompensation principles. We expect all employees, including contingent workers and contract workers, to adhere to our Code of Conduct, and we \nrequire them to complete our Code of Conduct training and sign off annually within 30 days of their hiring. In addition, RBC provides equal opportunity \nfor advancement and growth in the workplace by filling open positions based on business need, candidate merit and the RBC Values.Building and attracting talent\n2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  27   Creating experiences that enable growth\nWe are continually looking for ways to improve employees’ experiences at RBC so they can perform their best, excel \nin their careers and be recognized for what they do. Our success is fueled by highly engaged employees. That is why \nwe are focused on ensuring our high employee engagement is a differentiated strength and our employees continue \nto feel that RBC is a great place to work.\nTo better understand and respond to the needs and expectations of our workforce, we are using our employee \nlistening strategy to identify the critical “moments that matter” to our employees. Our people have helped us \nidentify key factors – meaningful work, supportive management, positive and flexible work environments, growth \nopportunities and trust in leadership – that positively impact their daily work life.\nBy engaging our workforce to share their ideas and feedback, we are better able to design programs and deliver the \nexperiences that attract talent and inspire, develop and empower our people.\nPerformance metrics Targets 2019 2018 2017\nEmployee Opinion Survey (EOS) response rate – 93% 92% 92%\nEmployee Engagement Index score7 >82 86 86 85\n     Men é 86 86 85\n     Women é 86 86 84\n     Minorities é 86 86 86\n     Persons with disabilities é 82 82 81\n     Indigenous Peoples é 87 85 84\n     LGBT+ people é 83 82 83\nPerformance Enablement score31é 86 86 84\nTotal hours of instructor-led and web-based training – 1.5 million 1.7 million 1.3 million\nTotal invested in direct and indirect training and career development32– $87.3 million $86.9 million $83.2 million\nTotal invested per FTE in formal training and development32– $1,054 $1,061 $1,064\nAverage hours of formal training per employee: – 17 213316\n     Management level – 13.2 13.5 10.7\n     Non-management level – 14.3 16.4 13.8\nPercentage of employees who indicated the following: “I am confident  \nI can learn new skills to be successful as my job changes.”– 93% 93% 93%For more information\nRBC Careers\nCareer, Community and \nConnection\na\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  28 Creating experiences that enable growth\nRecord employee engagement\nThe annual EOS administered by Willis Towers Watson (WTW) continues to provide an important pulse check on employee sentiment and the areas \nwhere we can further unlock their potential. In 2019, our Employee Engagement Index score hit a new record, four points higher than the benchmark for \nhigh-performing companies.  \nLIFT performance enablement \nOur approach to performance enablement across RBC (LIFT) is all about providing growth and development opportunities, regular feedback and \ncoaching and a simple performance review experience. While our performance enablement EOS scores have increased two points over the last two \nyears, we’re making further enhancements to improve goal setting, simplify performance assessment and increase manager capability to further enable \nour people through better coaching and feedback conversations. \nDifferentiated learning experiences\nWe’re fostering a culture of lifelong learning to ensure our people gain great experiences while building skills for the future. Examples include:\n¡   RBC Learn:  This self-serve digital platform offers a customized learning \nexperience to build future-ready skills. As at October 31, 2019, 77% of \nlearners say RBC Learn helped them feel empowered to continue to learn \nand develop skills to be successful.\n¡   RBCx:  This is a nine-week program where cross-functional teams use \ndesign thinking and innovation methodologies to solve real business \nchallenges. In 2019, 65 employees participated and RBCx has over 100 \nalumni from across the organization.¡   Spark!: Our new internal online platform enables employees to connect \nand work on projects outside their daily job description. Spark! hosted \nover 1,000 active users this year.\n¡   Teams such as OMNI  (250 employees) and RBC Ventures  (300 employees) \nuse design thinking and the pace of a startup to digitally-enable our \npeople and clients, and create solutions for consumers and to  \nbusiness problems.\n \nReskilling\nFor employees whose roles are impacted by automation, we offer reskilling through role and skill-based pathways so they can take on new and different \nwork at RBC. For example, in 2019 a group of Wealth Management operations employees whose roles were eliminated learned new skills to take on \nautomation developer, programmer or data analyst roles. In our 2019 Employee Opinion Survey, 93% of employees indicated they are confident they can \nlearn new skills to be successful as their job changes. \nEnabling our people leaders  \nThis year, we conducted internal and external research, brainstorming sessions and manager interviews to identify critical areas for improvement. \nSolutions delivered included a new intranet site as a centralized resource, a redesigned monthly bulletin built with manager feedback, simplified \nnotification tools to easily cascade information and a listening approach to obtain regular feedback from managers.2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  29   Driving a diverse and inclusive culture\nDiversity and inclusion is more than just one of our core values; it represents what we stand for, what we expect of \none another and how we treat each other. We believe diversity and inclusion is an engine for innovation and \neconomic prosperity. By actively driving diversity and encouraging inclusion, we generate fresh perspectives, inspire \nand empower our people to deliver their best, and ensure our workforce reflects the diversity of the clients and \ncommunities we serve.  \nWe are committed to taking action to drive sustainable progress in diversity and inclusion in our company and the \ncommunities we serve. We strive to be among the most inclusive and successful companies in the world, building a \nculture where everyone can thrive and bring their whole authentic selves to work.

To strengthen our pipeline of future leaders, we align talent management \nstrategies and succession planning with our business strategies and our Leadership Model. \nIn our approach to succession planning, we assess, identify and develop executives and high-potential talent to build their leadership capabilities and \nensure we have a diverse group of leaders who drive our performance. Our CEO and senior leaders are champions of our enterprise talent agenda and \nhave specific performance objectives relating to talent management and succession planning. The representation of women and minorities in executive \nand senior manager roles is an important measure of our progress in building a diverse leadership pipeline. In 2018, we disclosed our ambitious targets for \nexecutive representation and new executive appointments. This year, we identified opportunities to do more to accelerate these efforts as we did not \nreach our target for new women executive appointments.\nTo reach these targets, we are strengthening our \npipeline of top talent and driving inclusion at all \nposition levels. We are committed to attracting and \nretaining talented women and minorities, supporting \nand enabling their development and advancement in \nleadership and key client-facing roles.

We regularly \nmonitor the “safe to speak up” and “treated with respect” areas of our EOS, and take quick action to address any emerging gaps or concerns. \nIn 2019, we increased our Diversity and Inclusion Index score for the second consecutive year. The Index is a composite of seven items on fairness, \nopenness, flexibility and managerial support as measured through our annual EOS. We believe it’s critical to measure how our employees feel about the \nenvironment they work in: whether they feel it’s safe to speak up and they are treated with respect. \nPerformance metrics Targets 2019 2018 2017\nI am treated with respect at RBC é 92 92 91\nIt is safe to speak up é   804279 77\nManagement supports diversity in the workplace: recognizing, respecting and  \nleveraging differencesé 90 89 88\nMy manager solicits diverse perspectives as a way to uncover good ideas. é 83 82 81\nTo promote ongoing dialogue about inclusion, we invited people to have a frank conversation about inclusion, on camera. The discussions highlighted \nthat many misperceptions are still prevalent when it comes to gender (including identity and expression), race, religion, sexual orientation and ability. \nOur “Speak Up for Inclusion” video series generated over 200,000 impressions on social media. The videos complemented our efforts to educate our \nemployees about unconscious bias (which has reached over 46,500 employees since 2014), encourage radical candour and create a safe place to speak \nabout inclusion.\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  32 Driving a diverse and inclusive culture\n2019 Highlights\nSupporting our commitment to gender equity in pay\nWe are committed to the principles of gender equity in pay and we undertake actions to prevent pay disparities between men and women performing \nwork of equal or comparable value. We conduct gender-based compensation analyses as part of our annual compensation review processes, and review \npay differences, taking into consideration factors such as position level and tenure, business or function, and geography, all of which may contribute to \ndifferences in pay between men and women. We address any gender-based pay concerns identified in the year-end pay decision-making process \nthrough pay adjustments, where we identify that individual factors do not explain a difference in pay. Outside the annual compensation review process, \nwe review compensation when we move employees to new roles, taking into account external and internal pay benchmarks and the skills and \nexperiences the incumbent brings to the role. In addition, we complete gender and pay equity analyses and filings annually, where required, to comply \nwith Canadian federal Employment Equity legislation and provincial and federal Pay Equity legislation. Since there are a number of variables that are \nconsidered in establishing pay levels, we periodically carry out statistical analyses to eliminate factors that may explain variations in pay, including \nlevels of proficiency and performance, education, accreditation and role accountabilities, in order to surface gender-based pay differences. \nIn 2019, we began leveraging a business intelligence tool to help us determine the weight of variables that contribute to pay differences and, once \nadjusted for, identify if and where pay inequity exists across our Canadian, U.S.43 and U.K.44 operations. We assessed employees45 across different types \nof compensation (i.e. fixed salary, bonus, equity or commission). The table below describes our adjusted median pay differences (women remuneration \nas a percentage of men remuneration)46 for federally regulated employees in Canada governed by the Employment Equity Act. \nPosition groupMedian remuneration (adjusted) of \nwomen as a percentage of men47Representation of women in \nposition group\nVice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents 97% 46%\nSenior management 98% 44%\nManagement and experienced professionals 98% 59%\nAdministrative and operational employees 101% 78%\nWe are committed to closing the gaps and are taking the necessary steps to further analyze contributing factors and make appropriate adjustments.  \nAs we mature our pay equity analytics and enhance our systems and business intelligence tools, we will deepen our insights into areas of opportunity \nand implement appropriate, enterprise-wide measures to address contributing factors. With accessible insights coupled with relevant and timely \neducation and communication, we will continue to strengthen equity across our organization, reduce subjectivity in our processes and further mitigate \nthe risk of biases.\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  33 \nValue for   \nClients\nOur Priorities\n¡   Client satisfaction  \nand loyalty\n¡   Digital enablement\n¡   Privacy\n¡   Cyber security\n¡   Responsible investing\n¡   Sustainable finance\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  34 Client satisfaction increased in 2019 across our five business segments – and in many cases, we are leading our Canadian and global peers.

We have nearly doubled our investment in cyber security technology over the last five years. A \nfederal government advisory committee on AI is co-chaired by an RBC executive who oversees Borealis AI, \nour research institute. RBC also collaborates with a wide range of stakeholders on industry-wide strategies \nincluding training, commercial acceleration and applied research and development. \nThe RBC Global Privacy Office is part of the Regulatory Compliance group. The Chief Privacy Officer provides \nthe strategic vision for global privacy risk management, and designated compliance officers are responsible for privacy advice, oversight and challenge \nacross every business. Our privacy risk management program is based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) privacy \nprinciples as well as Canadian, U.S. and European Union privacy regulations, which include cyber security as part of the Security Safeguards principle. \n(Our approach to cyber security is discussed on page 40 .)  \nOur Privacy and Security  webpage and our Global Privacy Notice articulate how we collect, use, share and protect information. When we engage \nthird-party service providers to process personal information on our behalf: 1) we share only the information necessary to perform the services; 2) we \nrequire them to protect the information, adhering to RBC’s standards; and 3) we ask them to notify us of any actual or suspected privacy breaches so we \ncan work together to contain, remediate and, where required, report them. All employees are required to complete a privacy fundamentals course \nbiannually, which is supplemented with monthly enterprise-wide privacy communications. \nRBC did not experience any major privacy breaches in 2019.

This is a key commitment in our enterprise climate change strategy, the RBC \nClimate Blueprint , to support our clients in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\nTo achieve this goal, we are investing in our own capabilities. In 2019, RBC established the Sustainable \nFinance Group in Capital Markets to respond to growing demand for sustainable finance products and from \ncorporate and institutional clients globally who view ESG factors as important considerations in their \ncorporate strategy and investment process. This is in addition to well established capabilities in our \nenterprise Sustainability Group, Group Risk Management and RBC GAM. \nWe recognize the importance of transparency and have committed to disclosing our progress against our sustainable financing target. To determine \nwhat counts, we have developed a methodology for our Sustainable Finance Commitment, which identifies eligible environmental and social categories, \nthe types of financing and the accounting methodology we are applying. The sustainable finance market is evolving rapidly, with new criteria being \ndeveloped and innovative products and services becoming available.

The RBC Climate Blueprint is \ndesigned to guide us, working with our clients and communities, to contribute to \na healthier planet and more prosperous economy for the 21st century. Because \nwe believe it’s the smart choice.\nClimate change is one of the most pressing issues of our age – and the financial \nsystem needs to be leading efforts to support clean economic growth and the \ntransition to the low-carbon economy. Climate change is already a business \nreality for our clients, and many have embraced new ways of doing business and \nreframed climate action as an opportunity to improve and expand what they do.\nWe believe that capital can be a force for positive change, clearly demonstrated  \nby a new business target: $100 billion in sustainable financing by 2025. This \ngoal supports investments in sustainable companies and projects that are \nwidely recognized as contributing to the low-carbon, sustainable economy of \nthe future.\nWe aspire to help the world meet its energy needs and move to increasingly \ncleaner fuel sources. We are balancing our commitment to sustainable \nfinancing with investments in our energy and natural resource clients so they \ncan continue to invest in innovation and technologies that help them reduce \nemissions and remain leaders on the global stage.  \nThis approach to sustainability is central to our business and to our stated \nPurpose, which is to help clients thrive and communities prosper. We know \nwe can do this by taking the best of what we have today - of our human \nresources and natural resources – to build a better tomorrow. The choice \nbelongs to all of us.\nDavid McKay\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer, Royal Bank of Canada\n\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  58   Achieving net-zero carbon emissions in our global operations\nReducing carbon emissions and energy use is foundational to any corporate environmental program and an expectation of any organization that is \ntaking action on climate change. This is why, in 2017, we became carbon neutral and committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions in our global \noperations annually. We accomplish this through energy and emissions reduction programs in our property network and IT infrastructure, and by \nsourcing renewable energy credits (RECs) and high quality carbon offsets to account for emissions we cannot eliminate. Each year, we aim to be less \nreliant on carbon offsets. To ensure this, we have set two additional targets: reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 15% and increase our sourcing of \nelectricity from renewable and non-emitting sources to 90%, both by 2023. See Appendix II for more environmental metrics, including Leadership in \nEnergy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified office space, paper use and water consumption.\nPerformance metrics Targets 2019 2018 2017\nScope 1 emissions (tonnes of CO 2e) – 24,814 24,174 24,676\nScope 2 emissions (tonnes of CO 2e) – 89,76919102,0092096,917\nGHG reductions from green power purchases (tonnes of CO 2e) – -15,447 -4,718 -2,666\nTotal Scope 1 and 2 emissions (tonnes of CO 2e)21 Reduce by 15%  \nby 202399,13619121,46520118,92620\nScope 3 – business travel (tonnes of CO 2e) – 29,737 31,115 7428,625\nTotal GHG emissions (tonnes of CO 2e) – 128,87319152,58020147,551\nGHG emissions intensity from energy use (tonnes of CO 2e/m2) – 0.046190.055200.06220\nCarbon credits purchased (tonnes of CO 2e) – 128,873 159,91575147,551\nPercentage of electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources for  \nall propertiesIncrease to 90%  \nby 202377% 75% 72%a\na\na\na\naa\n¡   We increased our focus on renewable energy procurement by \nrestructuring our RECs contract with Bullfrog Power to invest in Canada’s \nhighest carbon intensity electrical grids and finance and purchase the \nRECs from the Fisher River Cree Nation's community solar project, the \nlargest solar farm in Manitoba. This resulted in a 13% reduction in total \nGHG emissions for fiscal year 2019. ¡   We relocated our Europe, Middle East and Africa headquarters and \nconsolidated  our London-based teams in a new Building Research \nEstablishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Excellent \nrated building. This building in London, U.K. is expected to be the most \nenergy efficient RBC office, worldwide. 2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  59   Speaking up for smart climate solutions \nOur voice matters. We were an early supporter of carbon pricing and more recently the need to develop a world-leading approach to clean innovation in \nCanada. Our ability to finance innovation in the decades ahead, create the technologies that will power the 21st century and help transform the economy \nto a cleaner one depends on the policy and business decisions made today. We are committed to informing public policy; convening stakeholders to \nadvance the pathways for change in Canada; and contributing research and thought leadership on clean innovation, climate-related risks and \nopportunities, and the implications of climate policy. There is a clean innovation play for every sector of the economy and we believe this will be an \nimportant driver of economic growth and prosperity.\n¡   RBC hosted the Transition Day of Learning, in partnership with NEI \nInvestments, Suncor, Teck Resources and the Energy Futures Lab. We \nbrought together over 90 investors and industry leaders to advance the \ndialogue on creating a clean-growth future for Canada. \n¡   RBC supported the work of the Canadian Expert Panel on Sustainable \nFinance as a champion and key contributor, and we were pleased to see \nthe publication of the Final Recommendations in June 2019. ¡   As a founding member of Smart Prosperity, a cross-sectoral initiative \nfocused on accelerating Canada’s transition to a stronger, cleaner \neconomy, RBC supports its initiative to call for better policy measures. In \n2019, this included a joint letter to Canada's prime minister and provincial \nand territorial premiers on key recommendations on how to move beyond \nclimate plans and get to implementation.\n¡   RBC partnered with Public Policy Forum, together with the Ivey \nFoundation, Suncor and Hydro Quebec, on a multi-stakeholder initiative \ncalled the Energy Future Forum, which engages a wide range of Canadians \nin a dialogue about what constitutes an economically dynamic, \nenvironmentally ambitious and politically acceptable energy strategy  \nfor Canada.  2019 Highlights\n2019 ESG PERFORMANCE REPORT  60    Investing in technology to address complex  \nenvironmental challenges\nInnovative solutions, based on technologies like blockchain, AI, machine learning and digital platforms, offer immense potential to address complex \nenvironmental challenges. We are investing significantly in these technologies for enterprise purposes because we recognize their potential to offer \ngame-changing solutions for climate change and environmental challenges. We also recognize that we need to partner with the best, brightest and \nboldest minds to accelerate and scale the deployment of these solutions. RBC’s goal is to bring the right partners together to tackle these global \nchallenges. That’s why we launched RBC Tech for Nature – our commitment to innovation, data and technologies for our shared future. RBC Tech for \nNature will provide up to $10 million in annual support to universities and charities that are developing technology solutions to address climate change.\n2019 Highlights\n¡   Through RBC Tech for Nature, we provided $7.9 million to universities  \nand charities that are solving pressing environmental challenges by \nleveraging technology and innovation capabilities.\n¡   Together with The Natural Step, the RBC Foundation supported the Energy \nFutures Lab (EFL) 2.0, an initiative powered by The Natural Step Canada. \nThe EFL is a multi-sectoral initiative that brings together the energy \nsector, technologists, policy makers, Indigenous leaders and funders who \nare focused on building the energy system the future requires. Initiatives \ninclude Energy.AI, which explores machine learning and AI to address \nclimate change and environmental challenges in the energy and  \npower industries.¡   Together with Borealis AI, RBC supported Mila‡: Quebec Artificial \nIntelligence Institute’s project called AI for Climate Change .

Our reporting in \n2018 and 2019 represents 99% of our global floor area. Our reporting in 2017 represents 90% of our global \nfloor area. Given the changes in our global floor area, we did not restate 2017 or 2016 figures. In 2019, we \nincluded GHG reductions from green power purchases in the calculation methodology for Total Scope 1 \nand 2 emissions and restated 2017 and 2018 figures using this new methodology. This change also required \na restatement of our GHG emission intensity from energy use figures for 2017 and 2018.  \n21   As a responder and signatory to CDP, RBC publicly reports multi-year data on absolute and intensity-\nbased GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) calculated according to the GHG Protocol. The GHG Protocol \nclassifies a company’s GHG emissions into three scopes. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from \nowned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased \nenergy. Our GHG emissions reduction target is calculated based on a 15% reduction against our fiscal 2018 \nGHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) minus emissions offset from renewable energy purchases. Aligned \nwith the science-based target methodologies based on the guidance for real estate and office properties. \n22   All employees must complete the Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing course annually. \nTargets are adjusted to >98% to compensate for fluctuations in short-term contract workforce, summer \nstudents and other expected variances or exceptions granted. \n23   Inclusive of total income and other tax expense, including income taxes in the Consolidated Statements \nof Comprehensive Income and Changes in Equity, to various levels of governments globally.

The \nESG disclosures comprise relevant sections of Macquarie’s \n2020 Annual Report and Macquarie’s website. The content \nof the disclosures is based on Macquarie’s ESG focus areas, \nwhich have been reviewed and updated in FY2020 following \nsecondary research, market benchmarking, media analysis \nand extensive engagement with internal representatives of Macquarie’s businesses across all regions. The adjustments \nto our focus areas reflect the issues that we have observed are \nmost important to our stakeholders.\n  Full details of the changes made to the focus areas \nand a GRI Index table are available at  \nmacquarie.com/ESG\n(3) Content includes conduct and conduct risk, psychological safety (aimed at staff and supervisors) and ethical decision‑making. Macquarie also requires \nstaff to undertake mandatory online Code of Conduct  training. \n44Environmental, Social and Governance\nContinued\nEnvironmental and social risk management\nMacquarie recognises that failure to manage ESG risks could expose the organisation to \ncommercial, reputational and regulatory impacts and affect communities, the environment \nand other external parties. Assessing and managing Macquarie‑wide ESG risks is a key \nbusiness priority and an important component of our broader risk management framework, \ndetailed in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report. \nUnder the Code of Conduct  all staff share responsibility \nfor identifying and managing environmental and social issues \nas part of normal business practice. Staff are supported by \nthe ESR team.\nThe ESR team coordinates a diverse range of ESG activities \nacross business groups and regions, including developing and \nimplementing Macquarie‑wide and business‑specific policies, \nconducting transaction reviews, providing advice on ESG \nrisks and opportunities and facilitating training. The ESR \nteam sits within the Risk Management Group and regularly \nreports to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and to the BGCC on \nESG‑related matters.\nESR in transactions\nEnvironmental and social risks are managed through \nthe implementation of the ESR and Work Health and \nSafety (WHS)  policies.\nMacquarie’s ESR Policy describes our approach to ESR \nmanagement in client on‑boarding and across a broad range \nof transactions including equity investments, financing, leasing \nand advisory mandates. The ESR Policy  provides a robust \nprocess to assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report \nenvironmental and social risks and takes a precautionary \napproach to ESR issues including labour and employment \npractices, climate change, human rights, resource efficiency, \npollution prevention, biodiversity and cultural heritage. Based \non international guidelines, including the International Finance \nCorporation Performance Standards, the ESR Policy  provides \nescalated decision‑making and approval processes, alongside \nthe credit approval process, for material environmental and \nsocial risks. Transactions with material environmental and social \nrisks are referred to the CRO and may be escalated to the \nExecutive Committee or Macquarie Board.The ESR team oversees the operation of the ESR Policy , \nreviewing transactions and providing specialist advice \nand targeted training.\n509  80\nstaff received ESR  \nand WHS training  \nin FY2020(4)staff received specialist \nHuman Rights training \nin FY2020\nMacquarie’s WHS Policy sets out our commitment to seek \nto operate zero harm workplaces through maintaining high \nWHS standards and performance across all our activities \nglobally.

GIG along with joint venture partners JERA and Swancor \nRenewable have now commenced delivering Formosa 2 through its construction phase. \nTogether Formosa 1 and Formosa 2 are important milestones in the realisation of Taiwan’s \ncommitment to deliver 5.7 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2025, and together will \ngenerate enough electricity to power around 500,000 homes in Taiwan.\nThe 128 MW Formosa 1 project, involving 22 offshore turbines, was completed on time \nhaving accumulated over 4.33 million hours worked without serious injury to workers and \na Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) of 0.23 (comparable to European wind farms).(6)\nMacquarie joined the project in 2017 and set an ambitious work health, safety and \nenvironment (WHSE) vision and strong expectations for the project that reflect our global \ncommitment to WHSE. Macquarie fulfilled key management roles in the project with \ntechnical experts (including the Construction Director, and Risk, Commercial, Contracts, \nWHSE, Permits, Consents and Package Managers) to ensure the success of the project \nin challenging weather conditions in an emerging market.\nWorking closely with Taiwan government authorities and the local supply chain throughout \nthe project, Macquarie has made a significant contribution to Taiwan’s competitiveness \nand ability to deliver world‑class offshore wind developments. The project has been \nimportant in the development of WHSE standards and culture in Taiwan. It has also \ncontributed significantly to expanding industry skills and creating jobs and opportunities \nin the local supply chain.\nMore detailed information is available at  \nmacquarie.com/ESG\n(6) Lost time Injury (LTI) is an incident that results in time lost from work equal to or greater than a full day/shift. The LTI Frequency Rate (LTIFR) is the number \nof Lost Time Injuries resulting in a compensable claim per million workhours.\n46Environmental, Social and Governance\nContinued\nEnvironmental and social financing\nWe have seen further growth in demand for environmental and social finance, often associated \nwith infrastructure and energy. This is driven largely by the global energy transition and areas like \ntransport and mobility, digital infrastructure, housing and healthcare where social needs are seeing \nclient demands for capital, innovative financing solutions and support for new technologies.\nMacquarie continues to support our clients seeking to manage \nand respond to sustainability challenges and capitalise on \nemerging opportunities. Drawing on our global network, sector \nexpertise and strong record, Macquarie provides a diverse \nrange of products and services with an ESG focus to corporate, \ngovernment and institutional clients.

We service clients across \nvarious renewable energy technologies including solar, wind, \nwaste to energy, bioenergy and energy efficiency.\nThrough the GIG, a signatory to the UN Principles for \nResponsible Investment (PRI) and Equator Principles, \nMacquarie is dedicating a growing proportion of our resources \nto early‑stage project development to help bridge the gap of \ndevelopment stage funding and accelerate the global energy \ntransition. Currently, GIG is progressing 25 GW of development \nprojects and is focused on delivering that pipeline into \nconstruction and expanding on it.\nMacquarie also advises, sponsors and invests in social \ninfrastructure, assisting public and private entities to deliver \nessential services including hospitals, schools, social housing \nand justice facilities.\n47\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries  2020 Annual ReportAbout Governance Directors’ Report Financial Report Further Information\nAccelerating the energy transition by bringing innovative projects to life\nFloating LiDAR systemWith its broad range of technical expertise in green infrastructure, Macquarie’s GIG \nis ideally placed to invest in emerging technologies, products and services and bring \nthem to new markets.\nIn Korea, GIG has been involved in the emerging offshore wind sector by completing \nthe installation of a floating LiDAR system for their floating offshore wind project at \nUlsan with target capacity of 1.5 GW. The LiDAR will provide critical wind resource \ndata to support GIG in developing the project. GIG was the first developer to install \na floating LiDAR in Korean waters.\nGIG has also established an active role in the growing global Power Purchase \nAgreement (PPA) market. PPAs act as an alternative source of revenue making \nprojects economically viable in low to no‑subsidy environments. To date, GIG has \noriginated PPAs supporting over 3 GW of renewables projects with over 15 corporate \nclients and other counterparties globally.\nIn Europe, GIG acquired the 42 MW Kisielice and the 48 MW Zaj ˛ aczkowo onshore \nwind farms in its first two investments in Poland. Generating enough renewable \nelectricity to power the equivalent of over 80,000 homes per year, the wind farms \nhave a positive impact on the energy mix in a country that is still largely reliant on coal.\nGIG has also been active in the solar market, constructing their first project in Spain \nand announcing an agreement with Tesco to install and operate solar PV systems \nat a number of the food retailer’s sites across the UK. This deal will help Tesco work \ntowards its commitment to generate 10% of its energy needs onsite by 2030.\nIn the US, GIG provided debt financing for an innovative battery‑based energy \nstorage project in Southern California. The fleet of energy storage systems will be \nused for utility grid services (including flexible and reserve capacity, solar integration \nand voltage management) in addition to retail energy services such as demand \nmanagement, back up generation and power quality enhancement.\nBloombergNEF Carbon Score\nIn 2019, GIG partnered with BloombergNEF (BNEF), combining its pioneering \nCarbon Score methodology with BNEF’s market‑leading renewable energy project \ndata to create a tool to assess the green impact of over 40,000 wind and solar \nassets globally.\nGIG’s methodology is designed to address the lack of information that makes \nit difficult to integrate climate‑related risks and opportunities into investment \ndecisions, by generating a simple and intuitive Carbon Score for renewables assets. \nThis enables BNEF clients to quickly, clearly and consistently assess and compare \nthe positive carbon impact of individual assets, fund portfolios or PPAs.\nThrough the partnership, GIG’s Carbon Score has been applied to over 60% \nof the world’s consented wind and solar projects to date. Power off‑takers can \nidentify opportunities to purchase high‑impact clean power, while asset owners \nand managers have access to robust data to quantify and report on the contribution \nof renewable energy assets and portfolios to carbon reduction more accurately.\n48\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nContinued\nManage\nMacquarie’s asset management businesses are committed \nto evaluating ESG factors in investment decision‑making and \nengaging with investors on ESG issues. Macquarie Asset \nManagement (MAM) is a signatory to the UN PRI. Divisions \nwithin MAM have established specific ESG policies and \napproaches that reflect the ESG considerations associated \nwith their business.\nThis year, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) \nhas introduced carbon and energy reporting for its fund \nportfolio companies. These metrics will inform investment and \nasset management decisions and, over time, enable MIRA \nto set targets for the businesses within each fund portfolio \nto achieve a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\nMacquarie Investment Management (MIM)’s Equity and Fixed \nIncome Investment teams have access to ESG analytical tools \nthat provide insight into companies’ and portfolios’ carbon \nfootprint, allow them to stress‑test issuers and portfolios for \ndifferent carbon pricing scenarios, and offer guidance regarding material ESG factors that affect a given industry. MIM’s Fixed \nIncome research team assigns their own proprietary ESG \nrisk ratings to new issues that they analyse, and its Emerging \nMarkets Debt team has established a differentiated approach \ntowards assessing Emerging Market countries on ESG.\n$A20.4brenewable energy assets  \nunder management \nat 31 March 2020\n$A2.0bassets managed under  \nMIM’s targeted Responsible \nInvestment strategies\n$A3.2bfunds managed in line with  \nMIM’s clients’ specific ESG goals \nand screening preferences\nMIRA agricultural fund\nIn 2019 MIRA reached final close of its carbon‑reduction‑focused agricultural fund, \nMacquarie Agriculture Fund – Crop Australia (MAFCA). MAFCA has a mandate to target \nimproved on‑farm energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions through sustainable \nfarm management practices. Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) is \nan investor in the fund and is working with MIRA and the Commonwealth Scientific and \nIndustrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), a world‑leading scientific institution, to develop \nan emissions reduction benchmarking model to be shared with the broader farming sector.\nMIRA has overseen and advised on the construction of an emissions calculation tool known \nas FarmPrint, with development conducted by CSIRO. FarmPrint is an emissions efficiency \nmodel that allows a farmer to input operational information pertaining to their farm and \ncalculate the intensity of their current emissions footprint (i.e. their FarmPrint). The FarmPrint \nmodel calculates the ratio of emissions relative to land area and the volume of crop output \nthat is produced for an individual farm.\nBy using FarmPrint, farmers will be able to identify and understand which parts of their \nproduction processes generate the most emissions, guiding decision‑making about which \ntechnologies and activities should be improved.\nSocial and affordable housing\nSocial infrastructure provides access to quality, affordable social services and offers \ninvestors long‑term opportunities in regulated non‑profit sectors. \nSpecialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) was introduced in 2016 under the Australian \nNational Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) to provide high‑quality housing to 28,000 \nAustralians with extreme functional impairment and very high support needs. Since 2017, \nMacquarie Specialised Accommodation Solutions (MSAS) has partnered with Summer \nHousing to provide 260 independent living SDA apartments across Queensland, New \nSouth Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.\n40 apartments completed along the east coast of Australia and dwellings in Fairfield \n(Victoria) and Newstead (Queensland) are fully occupied.

the potential vulnerabilities to climate change risks for Macquarie, we have developed physical \nand transition risk heat mapping for our lending and equity portfolios under 1.5°C and 3–4°C scenarios. \nThis analysis is intended to provide an assessment of relative exposures to physical and transition risks associated with each \nselected scenario across industry sectors and geographies. The analysis to date indicates the impacts on each of the sectors \nto which we are presently exposed would primarily be felt after 2030, and that the impact on Macquarie would not be considered \nmaterial given the diverse nature of our portfolio, the short time horizon of our exposures compared to these scenarios and the \nlimited size of our existing lending exposure to each sector. A more detailed report will be published as analysis progresses during \nthe FY2021 year.\n(7) MW of renewable energy assets in operation or under management reflect 100% generating capacity of each asset, not the proportion owned/managed \nby Macquarie. \n(8) LEED Gold, BREEAM Good, 5 Star Green Star or equivalent. \n52\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nContinued\nFY2020 scenario analysis\nThe use of scenario analysis, in the form of physical and transition risk heat mapping across our lending and equity portfolios, \nhas refined our understanding of the potential vulnerabilities to climate change risks for Macquarie. These heat maps are intended \nto provide an assessment of relative exposures to physical and transition risks associated with various scenarios across industry \nsectors and geographies, based on the current composition of the portfolio assuming no changes across all time horizons.\nFY2020 energy sector exposures\n1.3% of total funded loan assets(9)  \nand 2.2% of total funded equity investments(10) \nexposed to conventional energy at 31 March 2020\n13.6 % of total funded equity investments(10) \nexposed to renewable energy at 31 March 2020\nAs a managed global energy transition continues, it is clear \nthat there will be an ongoing role for conventional energy, \nincluding gas, for some time as the deployment of renewable \nenergy rapidly grows. Macquarie has played a leading role \nin facilitating the shift toward renewables and the wider \ndecarbonisation of the global economy. Particular focus was \nplaced on trying to address the various challenges that remain \nto full transition including energy storage, land use, the need for \na greater number of investible projects, particularly in emerging \neconomies, and greater levels of investment in adaptation and \nresilience projects. In FY2020 these efforts continued globally, \nsee pages 18–19 of this Annual Report. The table below provides Macquarie’s equity and loan \nportfolio exposures to the coal, oil, gas and renewables \nsectors as at 31 March 2020.\nEquity and loan portfolio exposures to the oil, gas, coal \nand renewables sectors:\nFY19 FY20\nLoan \nassets  \n$AbEquity \ninvestments \n$AbLoan \nassets  \n$AbEquity \ninvestments  \n$Ab\nOil 0.7 0.20.5 0.1\nGas 0.4 —\nCoal 0.2 – 0.2 —\nRenewables – 0.9 — 1.0\nTransition risk\nThere are numerous possible future pathways for the world to reach a particular climate outcome. We selected three divergent \nscenarios for transition risk, representing plausible transition pathways to 1.5°C warming by 2100 relative to pre‑industrial levels \n(including an orderly and a disorderly transition) and a 3–4°C warming by 2100 relative to pre‑industrial levels (or baseline scenario). \nThese were based on scenarios that informed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C \nand used the Potsdam Institutes’ Advance REMIND models.\nIn selecting these scenarios, a detailed review was conducted of a wide range of public climate scenarios. Our selection was \nbased on models that covered various climatic outcomes; provided information for the sectors and geographies most relevant \nto Macquarie’s exposures; are widely recognised and used by the industry; and are regularly updated.\nScenario assumptions\n1.5°C – ORDERLY 1.5°C – DISORDERLY BASELINE SCENARIO (3 –4°C)\nTime horizons 2025, 2035, 2050\nPolicy Immediate policy action consistent \nwith limiting warming to 1.5°C \nby 2100.Policy action is delayed until after \n2030, from which point action is \ntaken to limit warming to 1.5°C \nby 2100.The (Intended) Nationally \nDetermined Contributions to the \nParis Agreement by 2030 are \nimplemented, with an extrapolation \nof implied effort beyond 2030.\nEnergy By 2050, total electricity generation \ncomprises 91% renewables and \nprimary energy demand comprises \n68% renewables.Renewables comprise 19% of \nprimary energy demand in 2030 \nbut reach similar levels to the \norderly scenario by 2050.By 2050, total electricity generation \ncomprises 76% renewables and \nprimary energy demand comprises \n31% renewables.\n(9) Total funded loan assets include loan assets held at amortised cost adjusted to exclude certain items such as assets that are funded by third parties with \nno recourse to Macquarie. In addition, loan assets at amortised cost per the statutory balance sheet are adjusted to include fundable assets not classified \nas loans on a statutory basis (e.g. assets subject to operating leases). Total funded loan assets amount to $A86.5 billion as at 31 March 2020 ($A82.3 billion \nas at 31 March 2019).\n(10) Equity investments are reported on a funded balance sheet basis and therefore exclude equity hedge positions and non controlling interests. Macquarie’s \ncarrying value of its interest in East Anglia ONE Limited is $A2.8 billion, which has been partially funded with asset ‑specific borrowings of $A2.3 billion at \n31 March 2020. Total funded equity investments amount to $A7.4 billion as at 31 March 2020 ($A5.9 billion at 31 March 2019). \n53\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries  2020 Annual ReportAbout Governance Directors’ Report Financial Report Further Information\nFor each scenario, we analysed the vulnerability of our lending and equity portfolios at 30 September 2019, using modelling to assess \nthe impact of climate transition at a sector and regional level. In line with industry practice, our modelling assumed that there were no \nchanges to the portfolio across all time horizons, which will not be the case given the relatively short duration of our balance sheet \ninvestments and lending. Analysis of our lending portfolio showed that less than 10% could be exposed to sectors with a higher \nvulnerability to transition risk under the Orderly Scenario in 2025, rising but below 20% by 2050. Under the Disorderly Scenario, \na similar proportion of the lending portfolio could be exposed to sectors with a higher vulnerability to transition risk by 2050. \nFor our equity portfolio, the analysis indicated that under a Disorderly Scenario, less than 5% could be exposed to sectors that \nby 2050 demonstrate a higher vulnerability to transition risk while under an Orderly Scenario this would be around 5%. \nThe sectors most negatively impacted by 2050 as a result of carbon pricing and related policies include fossil fuel intensive industries \nsuch as coal mining, carbon intensive power generation, and oil and gas exploration and production. The utilities sector experiences \na high variation in impact, with the least carbon intensive companies experiencing positive growth. Within the transport sectors, \nair transportation is more affected than shipping, with road and rail transportation least affected due to the relative availability \nof electrification.\nRegional variations were identified at a sector level, influenced by the characteristics of the companies operating in each region \nincluding emissions intensity and market variations.\nAn example of the transition risk heat mapping is presented in the following graph. This reflects the potential transition risk impact \nat a global level for key sectors and is based on the average impact across all companies analysed within each sector. The heat map \npresents the anticipated transition risk for these industry sectors and does not reflect Macquarie’s exposure to these sectors, which \nis detailed on page 52.\nTRANSITION RISK ORDERLY SCENARIO DISORDERLY SCENARIO\nWORLD WORLD\nMacquarie Sector Groups 2025 2035 2050 2025 2035 2050\nAgriculture\nConsumer Staples (including Food and Beverages)\nCommercial and Professional Services\nConsumer Discretionary \nConsumer Discretionary: Automobiles \nConsumer Discretionary: Automobiles – Electric Vehicles\nFinancials\nHealth and Education\nTechnology and Telecommunications\nAircraft and Airlines\nRail Transport \nRoad Transport\nShipping\nChemicals\nHeavy Building Materials \nMetals and Mining\nMetals and Mining (Green Minerals)\nCoal Mining (Coking)\nCoal Mining (Thermal)\nGas Exploration and Production\nOil Exploration and Production\nCapital Goods\nCapital Goods: Renewables Equipment\nProperty and Real Estate\nUtilities: Power and Gas\nUtilities: Power Generation – High Carbon(11)\nUtilities: Power Generation – Low Carbon\nUtilities: Water and Sewerage\nLegend – Transition Gradient scale \nPositive profit impact No or limited profit impact Negative profit impact\n(11)  Represents those companies with emissions intensity above the median and low carbon represents those companies with emissions intensity below \nthe median.\n54\nBuilding on the heat mapping, we are conducting scenario analysis of carbon intensive sectors using a combination of portfolio \nlevel analysis and company level analysis to assess the potential financial implications of the transition scenarios. Initial analysis \nis presented below with more detailed reporting available later in the year. \nOil and Gas CoalTransition risk  \nscenario analysis(12) By 2050 under both scenarios, lending portfolio average default \nrates are forecast to double compared to the baseline.\nEstimated losses for the equity portfolio are similar under both \nscenarios and could be up to 50% of the current asset value by 2050.\nThe overall impact on Macquarie under both scenarios would be \nlimited and would not be considered material given the size of our \nexisting total lending and equity exposures. We note that the analysis \nassumes no changes to the portfolio across all time horizons, which \nwould not in practice be the case.Under both scenarios, lending portfolio average \ndefault rates are anticipated to rise by almost five \ntimes, peaking in 2030 under the Orderly Scenario \nand peaking in 2050 under the Disorderly Scenario.\nEquity portfolio – De minimis  exposure to this sector.\nThe overall impact on Macquarie would not be \nconsidered material given the limited size of our \nexisting lending exposure to this sector.Learnings and \nnext stepsMacquarie acknowledges the benefits of the combined portfolio level (top‑down) and company level (bottom‑up) analysis that \nwas undertaken in FY2020 and will build on this as we continue to refine our approach to climate‑related scenario analysis. \nThe company level approach highlighted limitations with the availability and granularity of data and the need to continue \nworking closely with our clients as part of ongoing relationships to support their plans to reduce their carbon intensity. \nPhysical risk\nWe selected two contrasting warming scenarios for the physical \nrisk analysis corresponding to global average temperature \nincreases of approximately 1.5°C warming by 2100 and 4°C \nwarming by 2100 relative to pre‑industrial levels. These are \nderived from the output of climate models driven by the \nwarming scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathways \n(RCP) 2.6 and RCP 8.5. The RCP scenarios are the greenhouse \ngas concentration trajectories adopted by the IPCC. \nThree time horizons were selected: including one to capture \nthe present day (2020), one for the medium term (2030s), and \none for the longer term (2050s).\nThe physical risk scenarios and time horizons used in the \nanalysis are shown in the table below.\n1.5°C 4°C\nTime horizons 2020, 2030s, 2050s\nIPCC Representative  \nConcentration Pathway (RCP)RCP 2.6 RCP 8.5\nWarming by 2100 relative to \npre‑industrial levels1.6°C 4.3°C\nUsing these scenarios, climate datasets were defined that \naligned with the modelling time horizons. The datasets \nincluded chronic climate changes, extreme weather events \nand climate‑related hazards such as wildfires. We then used \nsub‑sector vulnerability indicators that consider both direct and \nindirect impacts of physical climate risks to overlay the data with \nour equity and lending portfolios to assess the physical risk \nvulnerabilities of these portfolios.\nThe heat maps provide a strategic tool to identify potential \nareas of vulnerability and will be used to help inform further \nanalysis and investment decision making in our business as \nlending and equity portfolios continually evolve.The findings of this exercise were consistent with our \nexpectations that climate hazards are anticipated to increase \nacross the three time horizons, with the most severe impacts \noccurring after 2050. Country‑level analysis has resulted in \nsome smoothing of climatological variations which is more \npronounced across large and diverse geographic regions such \nas the US or Australia. Consequently, both the US and Australia \nwere assessed to have relatively higher physical risk profiles in \ncomparison with other countries, reflecting that the anticipated \nchanges in climate‑related hazards are above the global \naverage for these countries. While the heat map indicated \nvariations in vulnerabilities across sectors and sub‑sectors, \nthese were highly dependent on the country of exposure.\nDetailed physical risk scenario analysis of our retail mortgage \nportfolio in Australia is in progress and will be completed later \nin the year.\nSupporting global activity to better understand, \nmitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change\nMacquarie continues to support global efforts to better \nunderstand the impact of climate change on society, our clients \nand our business. This involves a diverse range of activity \nincluding engaging clients and assets; research projects into \nareas such as reducing agricultural emissions with CSIRO; \nactive engagement in initiatives like TCFD; and initiating \ncollaborative working with other financial institutions through \nthe CFLI and broader multi‑stakeholder initiatives like the GCA. \nThrough this engagement, Macquarie is working to improve our \nunderstanding of the risks associated with climate change while \nalso pursuing opportunities to work with clients to advance \nmitigation and adaptation.\nMore detailed information on our approach to  \nClimate Change is available at   \nmacquarie.com/ESGEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nContinued\n(12) Scenario analysis was completed at 30 September 2019 assuming a static book with no changes in composition over the modelling time horizons and \ndoes not include impacts associated with COVID‑19.\n55\nMacquarie Group Limited and its subsidiaries  2020 Annual ReportAbout Governance Directors’ Report Financial Report Further Information\nSustainability in direct operations\nMacquarie’s direct environmental and social impacts predominantly relate to the resources we \nconsume in our offices, data centres, air travel, and our procurement activity. We seek to manage \nthese impacts by monitoring and reducing resource use, maintaining innovative and sustainable \nworkplaces, maintaining carbon neutrality and improving the sustainability of our supply chain.\nThis year, Macquarie launched its 2025 Sustainability Plan, which \nformalises our corporate sustainability commitments with specific \nand measurable targets across environmental and social pillars.\nEmissions from energy use and flights\nThis year, Macquarie’s absolute emissions decreased by \n16% from FY2019 attributed to a reduction in Scope 2 and \n3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions are not considered to be \nmaterial, comprising 0.6% of Macquarie’s total emissions.(13)\nFY2020 Scope 2 emissions reduced 8% from FY2019, due \nto a continued focus on energy use in all Macquarie premises \nglobally, including retrofit and fit‑out projects that have delivered \nmore energy efficient premises and our IT cloud transformation \nstrategy that enables rationalisation of servers. Macquarie’s \ncorporate offices are fitted with water and energy efficient \nfittings and fixtures and are continually monitored for energy \nperformance, environmental quality and staff comfort.\nMacquarie sourced 18% of global electricity from renewable \npower in FY2020, up from 6% in FY2019, in line with our \nRE100 commitment to reach 100% by 2025.This year, energy audits were completed in EMEA in response \nto the European Union Energy Efficiency Directive requirements.\nMacquarie’s FY2020 Scope 3 emissions decreased by \n20% compared with FY2019 due to a decrease in flight miles. \nWe continue to encourage the use of virtual conferencing \nthat facilitates collaboration and helps reduce the need for \nbusiness travel.\nCarbon neutrality\nSince 2010, Macquarie has maintained our carbon neutral \ncommitment by working to reduce and offset emissions. \nIn FY2020, to meet this commitment, Macquarie purchased \nand retired a portfolio of Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) \nand other voluntary carbon offsets that meet the Gold Standard \nor Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community and \nBiodiversity Standard.

We have a responsibility to use \nthe power of technology to support financial \ninclusion, improve cybersecurity, fight financial \ncrime and protect customer privacy and \nsecurity. We recognise that the speed of digital \nchange makes certain sectors of society \nvulnerable to financial exclusion, and we’ll \nwork to tackle this emerging issue. \nDigital education \nWe developed our popular in-school \nprogramme, where Santander UK volunteers \nteach students about responsible money \nmanagement and career planning, to include \na new session around staying safe online. \nLaunched in December 2018, this helps \nstudents understand their digital footprint, \ndata protection and intellectual property. We \ndeveloped the materials with Young Citizens, an \neducation charity working in schools to educate, \ninspire and motivate the citizens of tomorrow.\nIn 2020, we’ll launch a digital skills support \nprogramme, ‘Go Digital’, to thousands of older \npeople in partnership with Age UK. Over half \nof this group classified as ‘internet non-users’ \nis over the age of 75, making this age group \nvulnerable to digital exclusion. Go Digital will \nbe focused on areas of the UK with high digital exclusion, and will include supporting older \npeople to access online financial services \nand products. Santander colleagues will be \nable to volunteer for these sessions and learn \nhow to better support customers with basic \ndigital skills.\nCyber security\nWe want to be worthy of our customers’ trust, \nreflecting our focus on best-in-class data \nsecurity. We aim to use technology in a way \nthat creates value for all our stakeholders and \nsupports financial inclusion. Technology should \nhelp simplify our processes, and make services \nmore accessible and convenient. It is our \nresponsibility to ensure the highest standards \nof data security which will help us earn and \ninspire trust. \nWe foster collaboration and information-\nsharing across the industry, regulators and \nlaw enforcement, and are on the Board of the \nCyber Defence Alliance. In 2019, intelligence \nshared by Santander has resulted in the \nsuccessful arrest of prolific criminals, including \none responsible for an estimated £41.6m in \nfraud. This helps to remove the root cause of \ncyber crime.\nEnhanced mobile and online banking\nWe’re continually working to make our digital \nservices more simple, secure and accessible. \nIn April this year we launched in-app \nauthentication for 3D-Secure transactions, \nthe process whereby a customer completes \na purchase using their card with an online retailer and Santander prompts the customer \nto authenticate. Historically we’ve relied on \nSMS one-time password for this process, \nbut through the in-app authentication journey, \ncustomers now have the opportunity to use \nthe biometrics offered on their device – \nwhether that’s fingerprint or facial recognition \n– to complete their purchase, offering a \nmuch more digitally engaged and customer \nfriendly journey. \nIn addition to 3D-Secure transactions and \nin-app authentication, we’ve extended these \nauthentication capabilities to customers \nmaking payment requests via Online Banking \ni.e. where the customer uses a laptop or PC. \nIn 2019 we launched Santander Chat to all \nOnline Banking customers, made up of \nan automated virtual assistant ‘Bot’ and \nmessaging via a live agent. This provides \nan authenticated platform for secure \nconversations and transactions. In 2020 we \nplan to bring this service to Mobile Banking, \nand increase the end-to-end transactions \nthat the Bot can perform for the customer. \nVoice ID, our brand name for voice biometrics, \nhad 226,490 registered users in 2019 since its \nlaunch in April. It enabled over 1.4m successful \nverifications last year. The registration process \nwas enhanced during 2019 with the \nintroduction of an assisted enrolment solution, \nmaking it easier and quicker for customers to \naccess this benefit through our contact centres \nand branches. We’re also developing the service \nto be accessible to customers who haven’t had \nthe PINs and Passwords historically needed to \naccess telephone banking.

We’re determined \nto uphold the highest ethical standards, \npromote human rights and responsible \ncorporate culture.\nOur commitment\nWe commit to being a fairer, more transparent \nbank. At the heart of this is the fair treatment \nof customers. We’ll deal with any form of \ncustomer fraud as a priority and are committed \nto raising customer awareness. \nCulture\nWe have nine ‘Santander behaviours’ which \ndescribe how we should interact day-to-day \nto bring simple, personal and fair to life. Our \nCulture focus in 2019 has included embedding \nAnti-Financial Crime culture across the bank, \nwith 8 Anti-Financial Crime culture roadshows.\nThird party risk \nIn 2019 we improved our governance process \nand policies around third party risk, including \na full review of how we audit third party \nsuppliers through control assessments. \nWe amended our supplier assessment process \nto reflect an updated risk appetite around \nmodern slavery and human trafficking.\nAnti-bribery and Corruption (AB&C)\nWe made significant developments in 2019 \nto our AB&C function, and doubled our central \nteam. As part of a drive to improve our policies \nand communication, we enhanced the AB&C Policy and Standards and cascaded \nthis to all colleagues, along with a top-level \ncommitment, charitable activity requirements, \nand Gifts and Hospitality (G&H) requirements. \nWe enhanced controls around G&H, third \nparties, universities, charitable activity, \nsponsorship and events, monitoring, oversight \nand record keeping. There has been an \nincrease of AB&C referrals in 2019 of 28% \ncompared to 2018 which confirms the increase \nin awareness of our standards and policies. \nOur Anti-Financial Crime strategy seeks to \ndeter, detect and disrupt financial crime, \nto protect our customers and communities. \nWe have mandatory ‘Fighting Financial Crime’ \ntraining for all colleagues and our Executive \nCommittee. This year we completed enhanced \ntraining for 92.5% of colleagues in central \nfunctions in high-risk roles. Following our \nAnti-Financial Crime Culture roadshows \nSantander held an AB&C conference \nincluding external professional speakers, \nwith 354 colleagues attending in person or \nvia live stream.\nTackling fraud and scams\nAuthorised Push Payment (APP) fraud is where \nthe customer is tricked into sending money to a \nfraudster. In April 2019, to protect customers, we \nintroduced a new payment process with tailored \nwarnings, sort code validation, display of the \nrecipient bank name and a voluntary cooling-off \nperiod. Since launch, across the digital channels \nwe have provided in excess of 53m warning \nmessages, delivered at point of payment and \ncirca 3m across branch and telephone.We also run ‘Scam Avoidance Schools’, a \ncommunity campaign to raise awareness of \nthe sophistication of scammers. These are \nrun in Santander branches and are free for \nthe public to attend. We participate in the \nBanking Protocol, a collaboration between \nthe police, banks and Trading Standards to \nhelp vulnerable victims who are in the process \nof being defrauded.\nResponsible lending and renewables\nIn 2019, Santander was the 3rd largest \nlender among renewable energy financiers \nin the sector by volume (2nd by number of \ntransactions) in the UK, and also ranked first \nby volume for advisory services in Europe and \nthe UK1. As part of this, Santander in the UK \noriginated £1.09bn of debt financing to 21 \nrenewable energy projects in 2019. We provide \nadvisory and financing solutions for renewable \nand alternative energy clients across a range \nof renewable schemes, including onshore and \noffshore wind, solar and biofuel projects. \nIn 2019, we introduced prohibitions and \nstrengthened restrictions on a range of lending \nactivities. Prohibited activities now include the \nprovision of products or services for new \nCoal Fired Power Plant (CFPP) projects and \ntaking on new clients with existing CFPPs. \nOur Reputational Risk Forum, which has Board \noversight, reviews and approves all restricted \nactivities to ensure that they fall within our \nrisk appetite.\n1 Information league tables 2019 \n12\nSantander UK Group Holdings plc  | ESG Supplement 2019\n2020 scorecard\nIn 2019, we created a company-wide Sustainability scorecard to activate our Sustainability Strategy across the business. Our scorecard sets our medium-term commitments, with a roadmap of activities for 2020 \nthat will help us drive and track progress on the strategy. To create this, the Sustainability team engaged with colleagues across the business to help them understand how our strategy applies to their area and set \na roadmap for progress, with input from external subject matter experts. The scorecard was approved by our board-level Responsible Banking Committee in December 2019. \nThe scorecard is structured in three layers: the four priority areas of our strategy; the medium-term

We focus on offering \na compelling investment proposition to clients through relevant products with the \nobjective of delivering superior performance.  BlueBay has an established track record \nof innovation across a broad range of specialist strategies, including relative return, \ntotal return and alternative investment portfolios in both public and private debt \nmarkets.  For more information about BlueBay as well as our ESG activities, visit our \nwebsite: www.BlueBay.com and www.BlueBay.com/ESG  \nErich Gerth\nChief Executive Officer\nToday, clients expect to be shown tangible evidence of how ESG \nprinciples are embedded in the investment processTaking ESG considerations into account has been an \nimportant aspect of our investment activities for many years. \n2018 saw substantial growth in client demand for investors \nto be more ESG-aware. Such a message has reached the \nhighest level of management as illustrated, at a dinner I \nattended of CEOs in late 2018, where there was a clear sense \nthat investors now expect their managers to integrate ESG \nas standard practice across all managed assets, and not just \nrestrict this to niche funds.  Today, clients expect to be shown \ntangible evidence of how ESG principles are embedded in \nthe investment process.  Such a message was not new to us \nas we have long anticipated these shifting expectations. \nESG touches each part of the organisation: it’s where our \nclients, and our employees, want us to go, and we believe it \nis the right thing to do. Furthermore, it is also an invaluable \ninvestment tool. Comprehensive ESG risk analysis allows \nour investment professionals to holistically assess the value \nof investee entities, improves risk oversight, enhances \ntransparency and stimulates engagement. \nI am pleased to report that in 2018, we made substantial \nprogress on our journey to more systematically integrate \nESG into the credit research process across our investment \nstrategies.  We established an issuer ESG evaluation process, \nwhich generates proprietary ESG Ratings and Scores for \nall investee organisations, allowing us to more clearly \ndefine ESG investment risks and opportunities, promote \ntransparency to our clients, and increase accountability of \nour investment professionals in applying ESG risk analysis \nalongside conventional investment criterion.  The process \nhas already facilitated greater engagement and collaboration \nbetween our ESG specialists and investment teams and resulted in an innovative ESG assessment framework that is \nbuilt on a solid understanding of the fixed income asset class.  \n2018 was also a year where we stepped up our collaborative \nindustry efforts such as working with the UN-supported \nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI) to share \nknowledge and insights and further advance industry ESG \ndebt investing practices.  This report provides more details \non these and many more achievements made.  \nWhile we are proud of the advances we have made so far, \nwe believe there is still much to do given how critical ESG is \nfor our business and the industry.  I believe that everybody \nin our organisation should be able to discuss and express \nhow ESG principles are incorporated within our investment \nprocesses in a succinct and uncomplicated fashion.  This is \nour ultimate goal.  Evidence of our ongoing commitment \nis the fact that BlueBay’s management committee have \nearmarked ESG as one of only two strategic priority business \nareas for 2019 (the other being Brexit).  As part of this, \nwe will conduct a strategic, firm-wide review of our ESG \napproach, looking at both the investment, and corporate \nresponsibility aspects. We will also be reviewing our newly \nimplemented issuer ESG evaluation process, to ensure we \nglean the maximum possible value from this proprietary \napproach to deliver strong investment performance and help \nour clients meet their ESG requirements. So, for 2019, we \nlook forward to showing our investors the positive benefits \nof our forward-thinking and thorough efforts in this area. CEO message BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nWelcome to our third annual environmental, social and governance\n(ESG) investment report, which highlights our activities, progress and \naccomplishments during 2018.\n3\nIn 2013, BlueBay committed to take a more strategic \nand systematic approach to incorporating ESG factors \ninto our investment practices. This decision to roll out a \nfirm-wide ESG investment risk management framework \nwas in response to growing client demand for a formal \nstructure and evaluation process for our conventional \ninvestment strategies, as well as recognising the \npotential investment value this could bring.\nOur work in this area has been built on a solid \nunderstanding of fixed income and ESG, as well as our \nevolving insights on how the two interact. Whilst we \nbelieve there is much we can learn from how ESG has been applied in the equity asset class, there are some key \ndifferences in the fixed income universe. Specifically, how \nbond prices and spreads are impacted, and therefore, how \nESG dynamics can play out. As such, our ESG integration \nframework needs to be workable across the sub-asset \nclasses of Investment Grade (IG), Leveraged Finance \n(which includes High Yield - HY), Emerging Markets (EM), \nConvertibles (CB), and Private Debt; as well as across a \nrange of issuer types beyond corporates.Our ESG investment approachBLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nThe decision to roll \nout a firm-wide \nESG investment \nrisk management \nframework offer \nwas in response \nto growing client \ndemand for a \nformal structure and \nframework\n4ESG investment strategies employed\nWe employ a range of ESG investment strategies for our managed assets:\nSource: BlueBay Asset Management\nNotes: 1 This refers to the BlueBay Luxembourg, Cayman Island, and Dublin domiciled funds; 2 This is a discretionary service available for clients where this is requested; 3 For example; climate change \ninvesting, social impact investing, microfinance, green bonds.• ESG integration forms the core of our efforts \nand is applied across all our managed assets, \nsupplemented by engagement where appropriate;\n• ESG negative screening (product based) on \ncontroversial weapons is applied to all pooled \nfunds;• ESG norms-based screening (conduct-based) and \nESG tilting is applied for a few specific, more ESG \norientated pooled funds offerings; and\n• Proxy voting is applied in more limited instances to \nour convertibles and leveraged bond strategies.\nESG \nintegra/g415on ESG \nengagementEthical (nega/g415ve/\nexclusions)\nscreeningNorms-based \nscreening ESG /g415l/g415n gESG \nbestin classESG (posi/g415ve / \nthema/g415c) \ninves/g415ng3\nPooled funds –\nex Global High Yield ESG Bond \nFund / Global Income Fund 1/g57/g57/g57\nPooled fund -Global HighYield \nESG Bond Fund /g57/g57/g57/g57\nPooled fund –GlobalIncome \nFund /g57/g57/g57 /g57\nSegregated accounts/g57/g57/g572\nPhilosophy\nThe ESG investment strategies BlueBay employs\nBLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\n5The fixed income investment \nuniverse is smaller than that of \nequities when viewed in terms \nof the number of unique issuers. \nHowever, the range of instruments \n(bonds) available for investors is \nbroader (given in equities there is \ntypically only one share class) and \nthere is greater variability in their \nterms (e.g. yield, maturity etc.). It \nis also possible to invest in non-\ncorporate issuers (e.g. sovereign \nbonds).\nIn equities, company share prices \nare more volatile and susceptible \nto being influenced by sentiment \nand views about potential future \nearnings. However, in fixed income, \nspreads and bond prices are less \nsensitive to such movements, as \nthey are more intrinsically linked \nto financial strength and the risk \nof default. BlueBay recognises ESG \ninvestment risk in fixed income is \ninherently multidimensional. We \nunderstand that not all corporate \nissuers will necessarily react in \nthe same way to a given factor or change, particularly when taking \ninto account their credit strength \n(e.g. HY issuers tend to be more \nsensitive to changes in financial \ncircumstances than those in the \nIG asset class as they carry more \ndebt).  Different issuer types may \nalso not behave in the same way \n(e.g. stated owned enterprises may \nbe less sensitive to external market \nshocks than private companies as \nthey have government protection). \nEven different securities for the \nsame issuer may react differently \nto the same external factor, be they \nESG related or otherwise. Such \ndifferences add to the complexity in \ndeveloping an ESG framework that \nis applicable across the entire fixed \nincome spectrum and can adapt to \nthe various nuances.Investing in debt compared to equities – some key differences\nESG Investment Risk Policy\nControversial Weapons Investment Policy\nProxy Voting Policy on Corporate Governance &\nCorporate Responsibility\nStatement on UK Stewardship Code\nStatement on UK Modern Slavery ActWe have adopted a number of ESG investment related \npolicies.Our ESG investment policies\nBlueBay’s ESG Investment Risk team (ESG team) is \ncomprised of four individuals dedicated to ESG, and is part \nof the Investment Risk department, reporting into the Head \nof that function.  \nTeam members as at 31 December 2018: BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nJean-Philippe Blua\nHead of Investment Risk, \nPerformance and Attribution\nMy-Linh Ngo\nHead of ESG Investment Risk\nLucy Byrne\nESG Analyst\nCamille Lancesseur\nJunior ESG Analyst\nDillon Neale\nESG Intern\nESG related industry memberships\nBlueBay has been a member of the UN-supported \nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI) since July 2013. \nThe PRI is an independent membership-based organisation for stakeholders active in the investment value chain \nseeking to work to support members to incorporate ESG \nfactors into their investment and ownership decisions.\nThe Alternative Investment Management Association \n(AIMA), of which BlueBay is a member, has been \nexpanding its work on responsible investment in the \nhedge fund industry.

In Europe, the \nEuropean Commission has continued to explore the \npotential of ‘hard coding’ ESG to ensure the future of \nEuropean finance is sustainable.  Whilst final decisions are \nyet to be made, it is new regulatory frameworks such as \nthese that have the potential to reset and transform how \nglobal financial markets incorporate ESG / sustainability \nconsiderations into investment activities.\nThroughout the year, the world’s media dedicated \nincreasing scrutiny to the negative environmental and \nsocial implications of climate change and single-use \nplastics. Social unrest was a prominent theme that \npunctuated the news cycle, driven by widespread social \ninequalities and concerns relating to corruption, cyber \nsecurity, and the implications that new technologies may have on human workforces. Global headlines also \nfeatured numerous stories on public health concerns \nlinked to products viewed as having a negative impact \non society such as tobacco.  In BlueBay’s 2017 ESG \nInvestment Annual Report, we predicted that the UN \nSustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) would \ncontinue to increase in popularity, both as a framework \nfor directing asset allocation and for reporting evidence \nof contribution to societal goals. Our predictions did \nindeed play out during the year.  \nIn the context of fixed income, we have observed \nincreased attention from investors on how ESG factors \nare taken into account we expect this trend to continue, \none data point being the global ESG investment \nstudy BlueBay and its parent company RBC GAM, \ncommissioned during 2018. Whilst more ESG orientated \napproaches are gaining traction, our view remains that \ninvestors want to see an integrated ESG approach as \nstandard. \nOverall, 2018 was a transformational year for BlueBay \nin relation to ESG. We are pleased to say we have \nmade progress on all our 2018 ESG priorities. Having \ncommitted to working towards a more strategic \napproach to ESG integration and 2018 saw a meaningful \nscaling up of ESG integration efforts across the firm \nincluding the launch of our formal issuer ESG evaluation \nprocess across all public debt investment teams (see \nthe text box for more details on how this works). We \nadopted an ambitious target to ensure all ‘provisional’ \nissuer ESG evaluations were completed by year end \n(i.e. the initial ESG assessment is completed solely by \nthe credit analysts, it is subsequently ‘finalised’ after being reviewed by the ESG team). Consequently, a \nsignificant portion of 2018 was dedicated to developing \nthe evaluation framework, enhancing the knowledge \nof credit analysts to better understand ESG risks in their \nrespective sectors and embedding the process into \nfundamental credit research.\nSimultaneously, the ESG team continued to develop and \nenhance the company-wide ESG data infrastructure and \nfurther develop partnerships with organisations outside \nof the business, including being a member of many PRI \nworking groups.New regulatory \nframeworks have \nthe potential to \nreset and transform \nhow global markets \nincorporate ESG \nand sustainability \nconsiderations into \ninvestment decisions Review of 2018\nPerformance against our 2018 ESG prioritiesReflections on ESG market developmentsBLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\n8\nBLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nFocus Area Progress Comments\nEnhance investment  \nchoice  \nESG integration is offered as standard in our \nconventional investment offerings. However, we \nrecognise that some investors seek dedicated \nvalue-driven ESG strategies and will continue \nto review the potential to develop these as \nappropriateThroughout 2018, we engaged with asset owners, investors and consultants to ensure \nBlueBay’s product offering remains appropriate. The majority of our stakeholders have \nunderscored their preference for ESG factors to be considered within our existing range of \ninvestment strategies. This aligns with our strategic focus on ESG integration.   Whilst there is \ninterest in more ESG orientated product offerings, the scope and nature of interest is variable, \nalthough it is clear there is growing interest in incorporating ESG considerations in sovereigns, \nand emerging markets.\nEmbed ESG in credit research\nRoll out a formal, systematic process to evaluate \nissuers on ESGThe process and content for the issuer ESG evaluation was finalised in the first half of 2018 for \nboth corporate and sovereign issuers.  By August, the evaluation process was formally rolled \nout across all public debt teams.  The analysts were set an ambitious target of conducting \na ‘provisional’ issuer ESG evaluation for all held investments by the end of 2018.  Over 90% \n‘provisional’ issuer evaluations were completed for both sovereign and corporate issuers, \nwhich totalled over 1,000 unique issuers – a significant achievement. \nThe ESG team were able to finalise over 25% of these ‘provisional’ ESG evaluations for \nsovereigns, and 15% for corporates.  Outstanding issuer ESG evaluations will be carried over to \n2019, with credit and ESG analysts required to conduct and finalise these as well as maintain \nthe process for future qualifying investments.\nDevelop ESG tools, enhance \ninvestment team support\nWork to build consensus, knowledge and \nunderstanding of investment material ESG sector \nrisks throughout the businessIn 2018, we updated an existing ESG briefing paper for the Energy & Mining sector to enhance \nthe knowledge of our credit analysts and help their understanding of ESG dynamics across the \nsector. Drafts for the majority of the other sector groupings were developed and we hope to \nfinalise these during 2019.\nStrengthen the ESG  \ndata infrastructure\nEstablish an integrated system combining ESG and \ninvestment data to monitor, report and inform on \nESG investment risks and performance.In 2018, we completed the first phase of our ESG IT/data infrastructure project. This involved \nthe creation of a new ESG data platform, which more robustly captures ESG data from \nBlueBay’s ESG vendors and combines it with our investment exposure to enhance investment \nreporting and monitoring.   In 2019, we will continue to work on developing and enhancing our \nESG investment reporting solution and further expand the array of ESG data points we input \ninto our systems for in-house monitoring, analysis and reporting purposes.  \nAdditionally, with the roll out of the issuer ESG evaluation process, we were also able to initiate \nwork to incorporate our proprietary ESG metrics resulting into our internal investment decision \nplatform (the Alpha Decision Tool).\nEmbrace wider  \nindustry engagement\nWork with key investment stakeholders to \nadvance thinking and practice in ESG fixed incomeBlueBay continued to build on its collaborative efforts with external organisations active on ESG \ninvesting again in 2018. We played active roles within initiatives convened and coordinated by the \nUN-backed PRI. This included continuing to chair the Advisory Committee on Credit Ratings, and \nparticipating in the ESG Bondholder Engagement Working Group and that on Cybersecurity.  When \nthe PRI launched the Sovereign ESG Working Group in 2018, BlueBay was selected to be a member. \nWe also participated in the PRI project looking at ESG in Private Debt.Partially\nAchieved\nPartially\nAchievedAchieved\nAchievedSummary performance against our 2018 ESG investment work programme\nAchieved\nSource: BlueBay Asset Management\n9\nThe PRI independently assesses its members ESG investment efforts each year, based on the member’s annual transparency report submissions. For \nthe 2018 reporting cycle (covering performance for 2017), BlueBay continued to outperform the median score in every category. UN-supported PRI’s external assessment of BlueBay’s ESG investment efforts\n10BlueBay has been developing a formal issuer \nESG evaluation framework for use by credit \nanalysts as part of their fundamental research \nprocess to facilitate ESG integration.  Whilst \nwe already source ESG data on issuers from \nexternal providers, we believe it is critical \nfor us to formulate our own independent \nviews, particularly given that third-party \nanalysis tends to be more relevant to equity \ninvestment than fixed income, and in some \ncases, there is a lack of ESG coverage across \nissuers. \nOur evaluation framework generates two \nproprietary ESG metrics: \n• a Fundamental ESG Rating, which \nindicates our absolute view of the ESG risks faced by the issuer.  This Rating is \nco-owned by the credit analyst and ESG \ninvestment team. There can only be \none Fundamental ESG Rating per issuer \nacross BlueBay, and;\n• an Investment ESG Score, which reflects \na relative view on the extent to which \nESG factors are considered relevant to \nvaluations.  This Score is solely owed by \nthe credit analyst. \nWe have purposely disaggregated our view \nof the ESG risks and how an issuer manages \nthese from their investment materiality. Doing \nso enables us to better understand the extent \nto which ESG risks are indeed investment \nmaterial, and in which circumstances.  This level of transparency is especially important \nfor fixed income, where the asset class \noperates differently to equity, and ESG \nfactors play our in different ways for various \nreasons.  We believe that the relationship \nbetween our proprietary metrics will provide \nus with further insights that will inform our \nwider knowledge and understanding of ESG \nfixed income dynamics, and ultimately our \ninvestment decisions.\nThe issuer ESG evaluation process requires \ncredit analysts to complete the initial ESG \nassessment (i.e. the ‘provisional’ evaluation) \nwhich is subsequently reviewed and \nfinalised by the ESG team (i.e. the ‘finalised’ \nevaluation).Our issuer ESG evaluation framework\nSource: BlueBay Asset ManagementFundamental ESG (Risk) Ra/g415ng \n[Issuer level] \n[co-owne d by credit & ESG analysts]\nVeryhigh ESG risks \nHigh ESG risks \nMedium ESG risks \nLowESG risks \nVerylow ESG risks Investment ESG Score (indica/g415ve)\n[Long posi/g415on at security / \ninstrume nt level]\n[owned by investment prof essional(s)] Descrip/g415on\n-3 Very high ESG investment related risks\n-2 High ESG investment relatedrisks\n-1 Some ESG investment relatedrisks\n0E SG considera/g415onsare unlikely to have an impact\n+1 Some investmentopportuni/g415es as a result of ESG considera/g415ons\n+2 High investmentopportuni/g415es as a result of ESG considera/g415ons\n+3 Very highinvestment oppo rtuni/g415es as a result of ESG considera/g415onsThe ESG outputs from the issuer ESG evaluation process\nSource: BlueBay Asset ManagementBLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nModule / \nAssessme nt results Score\n(pre 2015:  A being highest and D being lowest poss ible); post  2015 : A+ being highest and E being lowest)\n2014 repor/g415ng cycle\n(2013 calendar year)2015 repor/g415ng cycle\n(2014 calendar year)2016 repor/g415ng cycle\n(2015 calendar year)2017 repor/g415ng cycle\n(2016 calendar year)2018 repor/g415ng cycle\n(2017 calendar year)\nBlueBayM edianB lueBay Median BlueBayM edianB lueBay Median BlueBayM edian\nStrate gy & \nGovernanceAB AB A+ BA +A A+ A\nFixed income –SSAA\n(ﬁxed income –\ngovernment)DA EA CA +B A+ B\nFixed income –\ncorporate ﬁnancials B\n(ﬁxed income \n–corporates)DA CAC AB AB\nFixed income –\ncorporate non-\nﬁnancialsAC AB AB\n11Raphael Robelin, partner, \nCIO\nResponsibility for ESG \nnow sits just as much \nwith the investment \nprofessionals as it \ndoes with the ESG \ninvestment team.  \n Some refections from our Chief Investment Officer (CIO)\nQ Where has BlueBay focussed its ESG \nefforts in 2018?\nOur analysts have always taken ESG into account \nwhen assessing the credit worthiness of countries or \ncorporates. In 2018, we moved to formalise this process, \nmaking it far more structured and transparent.\nAs part of this new framework, whilst we continue \nto have an in-house ESG investment team which has \nresponsibility for guiding and overseeing our ESG analysis \nand engagement efforts internally with our investment \nprofessionals, we expanded the responsibility for ESG \nmore directly to the credit analysts, to ensure that \nESG is a core part of the analytical research process. \nResponsibility for ESG now sits just as much with the \ninvestment professionals as it does with the ESG team.\nQ Why is this latest development of \nhaving issuer ESG evaluations, such a milestone  \nfor the business?  What will be the benefit for \nclients?\n \nWe have now committed to ensuring we have a formal \nESG evaluation for every single qualifying issuer we \ninvest in, whether that be a sovereign, corporation or \nquasi-governmental institution. We have started by \nfocusing on all held issuers and will expand this to be \nstandard practice for future investments.  \nTo illustrate the business priority attached to this, we set \nan ambitious target of having credit analysts complete \nan initial assessment by the end of 2018 – we have over \n1,000 issuers and had only launched the initiative in \nAugust of 2018. We achieved over 90% at end year in \nterms of inital analysis conducted. The ESG team have \nbeen working to review and finalise the provisional ESG \nRatings and Scores assigned from this process, which will \nbe completed in 2019.\nSuch data will also be stored in our in-house investment \nplatform and ensure ESG data metrics are available \nalongside conventional investment metrics to inform \non investment decisions. During 2019, clients will start \nto see such ESG Ratings and Scores being discussed \nand reported at the portfolio level, promoting greater \ntransparency and accountability of our ESG integration \nprocess.Q How have clients informed the \nenhancements to BlueBay’s ESG process?\nIt is as much a journey for clients as it is for us. However, \nboth BlueBay and our clients believe in the importance \nof having a best-in-class investment process. To do that, \nwe believe you need to have ESG embedded at the core.\nWe could have opted to only apply our new ESG \nprocess to ESG funds, but we believe it is fundamentally \nimportant to always take ESG into account across all \nfunds. Yes, dedicated ESG funds will have a process \nwhere the very worst ESG Ratings will systematically stop \nus from investing, but ESG should be an input into all \nour funds. In the wider fund range, we may still decide \nto buy issuers with weaker ESG Ratings if we believe the \nESG risk is reflected in the price, but we will have the \nconfidence that we have the best possible view of that \nrisk.\nQ  What is the next phase of development \nfor BlueBay’s ESG approach?\n \n2019 will be the year that we begin reviewing the \nfindings of our assigned ESG Ratings and Scores on \nissuers.   We would like to ensure we have analytics to \nidentify the influence that ESG is having on investment \ndecisions and performance.\nIt is also about making this analysis part of standard \npractice. Every time we make a new investment, we will \nneed to ensure we establish an ESG Rating and Score for \neach company.   \nWe are also developing a proprietary research tool for \ninvestment analysts and we want to ensure that our \ncurrent issuer ESG evaluation is incorporated.\n11BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nESG in action – integration highlights\nEngaging with our investment professionals on \nESG highlighted some of the many opportunities \nand challenges of working to incorporate ESG into \ninvestment practices, including acknowledging the \nmulti-dimensional aspects of some factors, which \ncan be particularly acute in the debt asset class as \ncompared with equity investing.  Here we share some \nof the thoughts and insights from individuals across our \ndifferent investment desks on two areas of discussion.\nOur new issuer ESG evaluation process and \nsome of the challenges involved\nBlueBay’s newly integrated issuer ESG evaluation \napproach has aimed to formalise and standardise \ncomponents of fundamental analysis across our teams.  \nInvestment professionals have commented that with the \nnew ESG framework they can now systematically identify \nand evaluate material ESG risk factors in terms of their \nrelevance and materiality to credit risk. \n“It has moved me from a reactive approach to a \nproactive approach,” explains Oliver Grace, a senior \ncredit analyst covering the energy sector within \nBlueBay’s Leveraged Finance team. \n“Through this new, analytical approach, I consider who \nis at risk, who is best equipped to handle controversies, \nwho is doing the bare minimum and who could be \nvulnerable. I also get a much better sense of those \ncompanies that are able to navigate idiosyncratic shocks \nand headwinds from the regulatory environment.”\nIt has also provided a framework from which analysts \ncan more explicitly document the basis for an investment \ndecision on ESG grounds.  For instance, during 2018, \nVanessa Scarbonchi a financials and consumer analyst in \nthe Convertibles team was revisiting the credentials of \na global supermarket group. Historically, the team had \nnever invested in the company because of reservations \nabout the group’s corporate governance practices.  \n“We found the company had a very complex corporate \nand capital structure, and we felt it was poorly serving \nshareholders,” she explains. “These complex structures \nlater translated into decision making and reporting \nissues.”\n“Our assessment of the company’s weak ESG would \nlater translate into investment performance. It \nperformed poorly, and our decision not to invest resulted \nin a lot of alpha generation. We also avoided a name \nwhich became vulnerable from a headline perspective \nand carried reputational risk.”\nCommenting from a portfolio management perspective \non the value of the new process to his team’s investment activities, HY senior portfolio manager Justin Jewel states \nthat: \n“When there is an ESG risk that we have identified of \nsome materiality to a business, we ask, how serious \nis the risk? Does it materially affect the investment \noutlook? And is it a near-term or long dated potential \nrisk that we can’t easily price?”. This process, he says, \nsets a “higher bar” for the strategy.\nJana Velebova, a senior portfolio manager in our \nEmerging Markets (EM) desk, responsible for sovereign \nand blended strategies, explains how she sees our \napproach as compared with peers. \n“Speaking to others in the industry, most houses \nare looking at ESG as something that is quite quant \nfocussed, using simple rankings off the back of an \nexternal ratings framework. Our approach is unique. \nThe huge amount of resources that we have allocated \ninternally, coupled with our knowledge of sovereign \nrisk, allows us to be bespoke about how we incorporate \nESG risks into our investment decisions. This is far \nsuperior to being solely reliant on rankings from external \nproviders, which can be very backward-looking, or are \na simplification of the situation which we are dealing \nwith.”\nThe extent to which it is possible to conduct quality ESG \nassessments is a function of the availability, consistency \nand reliability of data.  Our analysts researching EM and \nHY companies highlighted this is a particular challenge, \nwhere they are having to work with inconsistent or \nnon-existent corporate disclosures, which can mean \nadditional time being dedicated to researching one \ncompany or its issuers.\n“It can be very disparate,” says Alex Collins, our EM \nextractives analyst. “You will have examples where \ncompanies only report annually but they will not publish \ntheir financials online. And, if there are no financials, \nyou can guarantee there will not be an ESG report.”\nCollins explains that additional efforts are made to \nresearch all ESG factors that may impact an emerging \nissuer’s risk, but stresses that instances where \ninsufficient information is available it will almost always \nresult in companies being excluded from the investment \nprocess as it may be more reflective of broader limited \nfinancial transparency which can be a red flag.\nEncouragingly, our analysts feel the data situation is \nimproving.  “In the natural resources sector, there \nis a greater focus on sustainability,” observes Esther \nKrukowski, a senior corporate analyst for the Convertibles \ndesk, leading the extractives and TMT sectors. “There James Macdonald\nPartner, Senior Corporate \nAnalyst - Investment GradeGraham Stock\nPartner, EM Senior \nSovereign Strategist -  \nEmerging MarketsAlex Collins\nCorporate Analyst -  \nEmerging Markets\nEsther Krukowski\nSenior Corporate Analyst - \nConvertibles\nViews from our investment team on incorporating ESG into debt investing \n12BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nViews from our investment team on incorporating ESG into debt investing \n13has been a tilt towards investment in renewables by the \nintegrated majors. Investor presentations now feature \ndedicated updates on ESG related projects and policies.”\nOn determining ESG investment materiality\nIn terms of the relative importance of E, S and G risks \nto debt investing, there is broad consensus across our \ninvestment teams that governance is key and particularly \ncritical in some instances.  Typically, the governance part \nof credit analysis has the quickest feed through into price \naction in the market, so this requires the most detailed \nreview.\nJames Macdonald, a senior credit analyst in the \nInvestment Grade (IG) team covering financials explains \nthat his team has dedicated significant time to looking \nat governance issues within the sector, having identified \nrisks relating to management, product and technological \nfailings. \n“We have spent a lot of time understanding governance \nby looking at the composition of boards, the \nindependence of risk and audit committees, compliance \nteams and studying corporate reporting lines. It is about \ntrying to identify where there is any weakness.  You \nare dealing with large, complex organisations which \nmeans it can be difficult to spot individual issues, but \nif you can identify weaknesses at the top end, it can \nbe symptomatic of an institution that is likely to have \nweaknesses throughout its organisation.”\nMacdonald says the financial services sector – and \nbanks, in particular – can present a particularly difficult \nchallenge because they are highly regulated institutions, \nso his focus is not on regulatory failings, but more on \nwhat could eventually lead to a regulatory failure.\n“Understanding governance and culture is extremely \nimportant,” he says. “Most banks are regulated and \nmany of them are listed, so you might assume that the \ngovernance would be consistent. Actually, there can be \nconsiderable differences.”\nWhilst governance is also important to sovereign issuer \nanalysis, political factors, are also an extremely important \npart of the governance element for sovereign issuers as \nGraham Stock, a senior sovereign strategist and partner \nwithin BlueBay’s EM team explains.\n“In corporates, the governance element can mean \nlooking at management, but it is a little more nuanced \nwhen it comes to sovereigns because governments \nchange at elections, in a democracy, Some governments \nmay be lacking in some areas, but this may not have an \nimpact on their credit prospects. For example, minority \nrights might be weaker than we would like, but it might be difficult to draw a link with the issuer’s ability to \nrepay.”\nGovernance has particular relevance depending on the \nsub-asset class, and in thinking about credit quality.  \n“For High Yield, governance is number one,” says senior \nportfolio manager Justin Jewell. \n“Investment Grade companies are typically, large, well \nrun, professional companies with a clear (or reasonable) \nalignment between equity holders and creditors. In High \nYield debt, that alignment can be questionable and the \nquality and time horizon, of both the management and \nthe owners, can be a little different.”  \nBeyond governance, the materiality of social and \nenvironmental issues may take on a sectoral and regional \ndimension. A good illustration of that comes from the \npoints our HY energy analyst Oliver Grace makes. He \nstates that alongside governance, corporate safety \nrecords are also key for his companies, as a poor track \nrecord throws up the potential for costly litigation and \nnegative regulatory consequences. Grace explains \nthat while the investor community have been less \nconcentrated on the carbon footprints of smaller energy \ncompanies in the HY space, they have still been keenly \nfocussed on other environmental issues, which they \nconsider to be material to the financial performance of \nthese businesses.\nIn the US, certain states such as California and New \nYork take a dim view of energy companies that do not \nappropriately manage safety and environmental risks \nrelated to the extraction and distribution of natural \nresources. One regional oil and gas producer has taken \nsteps to manage its water use, placating the tough \nregional authorities in the state in which it operates.\n“We like companies like this, which have taken a \nproactive approach to recycle the water it uses, by \ntreating and distributing it back to the local agricultural \ncommunity,” Grace explains.\nThe significance of context is also a point to bear in mind, \nand the fact that ESG trends are dynamic.  EM extractives \nanalyst Alex Collins states that for his sectors, there is \na general perception that ESG standards and practices \nare lower in such regions as compared with developed \nmarkets.  He argues that the situation is changing.\n“Previously, the environmental standards have been \nlower.  But what we are now seeing is a trend in these \nmarkets to try and bridge the gap with their developed \nmarket peers.”\nThe nature of the sub-asset class is also something which BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nOliver Grace\nSenior Corporate Analyst -  \nHigh Yield\nVanessa Scarbonchi\nSenior Corporate Analyst  \n- ConvertiblesJana Velebova\nSenior Portfolio Manager -  \nEmerging Markets\nJustin Jewell\nPartner, Senior Portfolio \nManager - High Yield\n\nimpact potential sensitivity of an issuer to ESG or indeed \nany other risks.  Unlike the other fixed income desks \nwithin BlueBay, the Convertibles team uses instruments \nwhich are sensitive to equity prices, making them unique \nwithin the business.  \n“A convertible bond provides fixed income protection \nand equity optionality, so investor sentiment is \nimportant”,  explains Esther Krukowski.  \nFactoring time horizons also influences the assessment \nof investment materiality of ESG factors.  Collins explains \nthat analysts must consider both short and long-term ESG \ninvestment implications, which can have a positive as well \nas negative influence on decision-making.  \n“You want to keep an eye as far ahead as you possibly \ncan.  But If there is a short-term trade which has a three- \nto six-month time horizon, a longer term ESG regulatory \nrisk may not matter so much as in these instances, this is \nless significant in the short-term.  But if this was to form \na core holding, then it becomes more of an investment \nissue.”\nThe nature of the issuer type may also come into play \nhere.  For instance, our sovereign investment teams also \nwork to ensure that social and environmental metrics \nare considered, but with a longer-term view. These \nare usually considered along with the macro analysis, \nalthough they are not always assessed within the same \ntimescale as the investment horizon, which can be \nshorter in nature.“In terms of environmental issues, governments can \ninfluence the environmental framework in a way \nthat companies cannot. So, we assess the quality of \nregulations and the implementation. On the social \nside, we look for indications of social strengths and \nweaknesses in a country.”  explains Jana Velebova, our \nEM sovereign senior portfolio manager. \nWhile it could be argued that environmental and social \nfactors only emerge gradually, BlueBay believes it is \nimportant to study these metrics, as a build-up of these \nfactors can lead to one small problem acting as a trigger \npoint for an issue that has taken many years to emerge.\n“Often, you have a confluence of several factors that lead \nthe country to a tipping point,” explains Velebova.\n“When the investment world has had enough, it reacts to \na key event that, normally, it would not have. This can be \ndue to a sum of the weaknesses on the ESG front, so it is \nimportant to keep track. The Arab Spring was triggered \nby an ESG factor, a single event that woke up entire \npopulations and investors alike, and which was quickly \nreflected in price action.”\n14\n15\n\nCompany profile\nA state-owned integrated \nelectricity company in the \nEmerging Markets universe.\nBackground\nTowards the end of the year, \nwe met with representatives of \nhis quasi-government entity to \ndiscuss a range of ESG matters. \nThe company had only \nrecently become aware of the \ngrowing significance of having \npositive G credentials, and its \nrepresentatives were keen \nto learn more about how the \ncompany was perceived by the \ninvestor community in terms \nof managing key ESG risks.\nAction and outcome\nDuring the meeting, it became \napparent that there was a \ngap between the company’s \nperception of the quality of its \nESG practices and reporting, \nand that of investors. This \nresulted from a difference \nin understanding of what \ninvestors consider to be the \nmost material ESG risks facing \nthe company is. Management \nstated that whilst there were \nsome structural issues (such \nas its energy mix, which has a \nhigh carbon footprint given its \nelectricity is currently sourced \nfrom a combination of gas and coal assets), which were \nmore challenging to address \nin the near term, they could \nidentify clear practical steps to \nbetter reflect their practices in \nother ESG areas, and that our \nfeedback had been valuable \nin determining these. We \nexpect to see meaningful \nimprovement in the company’s \nESG practices and reporting in \nthe future.\nInvestment view\nWe continued to have \nexposure to the issuer pre \nand post the meeting and \nbelieve this is one of the better \nmanaged company’s within \nthe peer group. As a result of \nour meeting we expect to see \nimprovements in ESG practices \nand disclosure and view that \ngood ESG momentum could \nbe positive from a credit \nperspective.\n16Issue & sector\nCybersecurity management by \na range of companies in a range \nof sectors (such as healthcare, \nretail, telecommunications, \nmedia and technology (TMTs) \nand financials) and geographies \n(UK, Europe and North America), \nacross the IG and HY universe.\nBackground\nAs well as co-leading the \nengagement with a global \nfinancials company as part of \nthe PRI coordinated investor \ninitiative on cyber security, \nwe participated in meetings \nconvened by other investors \nto improve our knowledge \nand understanding of how \ncompanies are approaching \nthe issue of data security \nand privacy.  Given this is an \nemerging and growing risk, such \ndiscussions inform on our views \non good practice.\nAction and outcome\nParticipating in meetings with a \nrange of companies in different \nsectors and geographies helped \nenhance our knowledge and \nunderstanding of data security \nand privacy risks as emerging risk \nissues.  During the discussions, \nit became apparent there is not \nnecessarily a clear consensus on \nwhat good practice looks like. However, the involvement of \nthe board in providing oversight \nand socialisation of the issue, \nbeyond its technical aspects are \nconsidered key, particularly in \nlight of the potential scale of \nimpacts on businesses. \nInvestment view\nWhilst cybersecurity is relevant \nto many sectors, we believe \nit has more significance from \nan investment perspective to \nretailers, financials and TMT \nwho are handling large volumes \nof personal and financial data \nand are consumer facing.  Those \nwith presence in Europe also \nface more regulatory risk.  We \ncontinue to be involved in the \nPRI cybersecurity working group \nand will apply our learning \nproactively to engage with \nissuers we meet where we feel \nthis is a potentially investment \nrelevant issue. CASE STUDY 2Engagement\nIn 2018, most of our ESG engagement efforts were focussed on gaining \na better understanding of how material ESG risks were being managed \nat the investee entities. This occurred at an issuer, sectoral or thematic \nlevel, and were conducted directly by BlueBay, or through working \ncollaboratively with other investors and key stakeholders, both reactively and more strategically.  In many of these instances, as part of the \nengagement process, the aim was also to influence issuers and other \nstakeholders on how to better manage and/or report on investment \nmaterial ESG issues such as culture and ethics, cybersecurity and climate \nchange.  \nCASE STUDY 1ESG in action – stewardship highlights BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\n17BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nSovereign profile\nA European sovereign issuer in \nDeveloped Markets.\nBackground\nThe government of this \nEuropean municipality has long \nexpressed a strong desire for \nincreased regional autonomy \nfrom another sovereign, \nwhich is it’s constitutional \nmonarchy. In 2017, an unlawful \nindependence referendum was \nheld, which led to increased \ninvestor uncertainty about \nthe risks to outstanding debt \ncommitments linked with the \nentity involved.\nAction and outcome\nBlueBay has long been in \ndialogue with each of the \nrespective government \nentities about the need to \nbetter understand their \nrespective positions and look \nfor compromise.  Since the \n2017 event, we have continued \nto engage with both issuers, \narguing for greater dialogue to \nnegotiate differences and reach \na solution.  Understandably, \nthe situation is complex, and \ndialogue remains ongoing.\nInvestment view\nWe have continued to have \nexposure to either one or both entities within our developed \nmarket sovereign strategies \nover the course of 2018 \nand are actively monitoring \ndevelopments.  We believe \na potential solution that \nwould be positive from an \ninvestment perspective would \nbe if both parties could agree \non an approach where the \nother was able to gain greater \nautonomy without requiring \nindependence, an approach \nwe have seen work in other \ninstances.CASE STUDY 3\n\nESG in credit risks and ratings\nChaired by BlueBay, this PRI co-ordinated group seeks \nto promote awareness, understanding and knowledge \nabout how ESG factors impact credit risk analysis and \ncredit ratings.\nDuring 2018, the group published it’s second report \nsummarising the outcomes of the various events \nconvened in Europe and North America for investors and \ncredit rating agencies (CRAs). From the work to date, it is \nclear that ESG incorporation is still largely seen as a tool \nto mitigate downside risk, and whilst there is consensus \non the importance of the ‘G’, more work is needed \non the ‘S’ and ‘E’. Furthermore, there is increasing \norganisational resourcing and transparency on how ESG \nfactors are being integrated into debt analysis, which are \nboth welcomed. The initiative convened further events \nacross Asia towards the end of 2018. A final report of the \ncurrent phase of the project is scheduled for release in \n2019.\nESG bondholder engagement\nThe aim of this PRI-co-ordinated group is to advance \nthinking and practice among debt investors on ESG \nengagement. In April, the group published a report  \nintended to provide an overview of current market \npractice and draw together a guide on good/best \npractice, which BlueBay contributed to. Overall, there was a clear consensus within the group that engagement \nis an important tool for ESG investors. We found this \npositive trend particularly encouraging given our belief \nthat while we are not owners of companies we invest in, \nas lenders of capital, bondholders still have potential to \ninfluence business practices through engagement. \nESG in private debt\nBlueBay was also part of the PRI investor group tasked \nwith publishing a briefing paper on ESG in Private \nDebt. We participated in discussions and interviews \nthat informed the content of the report, which will be \navailable in 2019.\nSovereign ESG investing\nIn late 2018, the PRI established a working group on \nsovereigns to explore good practice in terms of ESG \nintegration and engagement. BlueBay is a member of this \ngroup, which is due to publish its findings during 2019.\n \nSeparately, we have been collaborating with our \nsovereign ESG vendor, Verisk Maplecroft on a joint \nresearch project exploring ESG and investment \nperformance. The findings will also be published in 2019.Collaborations to advancing thinking and practice on ESG debt investing  \nBlueBay employed proxy voting 20 times in 2018, relating \nto 15 separate companies. \nThese votes were in relation to investments in our \nConvertibles, HY and EM strategies. In all instances, \ndecisions were related to corporate governance matters. BlueBay voted in line with management recommendations \nin most cases. In two instances, we voted against the \nmanagement team and in another two, we abstained \nfrom some of the resolutions. The abstentions and votes \ncast against management were in relation to two separate \ncompanies, one in the EM strategy and another in the HY \nstrategy.\n18Proxy voting BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\n19BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\n\nLooking ahead to 2019\n20BLUEBAY ANNUAL ESG INVESTMENT REPORT 2018\nThoughts on ESG market trends\nThinking ahead to 2019, we believe ESG change will \ncontinue apace. Coupled with volatile and challenging \ninvestment environments, this makes taking a proactive \nand holistic approach to investing critical in our efforts to \nprotect and enhance client assets.\nOn the policy front, we believe at the European level we \nmay start to see more details on ‘what’ and ‘how’ the \nEuropean Commission intends to embed ESG into financial \nmarkets. As China continues to advance its green finance \nagenda and mandates environmental action, we also \nexpect this will increasingly motivate other governments \nand regions to act.\nThe increasingly active role of banks, central banks and \nregulators globally in promoting sustainable finance \nto manage systematic ESG risks in recent years is most \nwelcomed. We expect this to continue into 2019 but \nbelieve such efforts must be coordinated to ensure there is \nglobal alignment of policy and practice.\nLooking at the environmental pillar, we expect climate \nchange to remain a strategic focus area given the growing \nsense of urgency around the approaching ‘tipping \npoint’ for global temperature increases, after which \nmaterial negative physical consequences will result if \ninadequate action is taken. Our view is that the scope of \nfocus will continue to broaden in 2019 to more explicitly \nencompass agriculture and land use, industrial processes \nand transport, as well as the social dimension of a ‘just’ \ntransition, which is gathering momentum. We expect \nreporting requirements on and quantifying risk exposure \nand resilience to climate risk will intensify.Alongside climate, is the wider challenge of ensuring \nsustainable natural resource management to avoid \nenvironmental degradation. We would like to see concepts \nsuch as the circular economy gain greater traction to \naddress issues such as waste, pollution and ecosystem \ndiversity. Corporate supply chains will increasingly be an \narea of focus. We predict attention will expand to including \npackaging material as well as clothing and other household \ngoods.\nWe believe that wider social and governance elements will \nremain important. Corruption and income inequalities at \na societal level, and the social side of development, will \nincreasingly fuel debates and discussions about what sort \nof development and progress we want and need.  Lastly, \nwe believe the ongoing implications of the digitalization \ntrend will continue to emerge in 2019. This is also \nlikely to materially change the shape of critical societal \ninfrastructure and some services.\n2019 ESG priorities \nESG as business priority for BlueBay has never been \nstronger. This is is most clearly illustrated by our \nManagement Committee’s adoption of ESG as one of \ntwo strategic priorities for 2019. Specifically, the aim is to \nensure there is full integration of ESG into all aspects of our \nbusiness. \nWe have summarised the main focus areas within \nour 2019 ESG work programme. With strong firm-\nwide support and commitment from the firm’s senior \nmanagement, 2019 promises to be another exciting year \nfor BlueBay’s ESG investment journey.\n20ESG has been \nadopted by BlueBay \nas one of two \nstrategic priorities for \n2019.

Wewould like to start this year’s report with twopersonal reflections on the issues and events, andalso some highlights and disappointments, that2018 has brought to the world of responsibleinvestment.\nFranziska’s highlights of 2018\nResearch trip to the US\nMy personal highlight in 2018 was an interesting\nresearch trip to the US with James Heal, ResearchDirector and Head of Ruffer’s Energy Group. Thetrip included company visits in Houston, Texas andattending the inspiring PRI in Person conference inSan Francisco.\nHouston, Texas\nWe met with a number of oil services companies:\nApergy, National Oilwell Varco, Tenaris,Transocean and EOG Resources. The purpose ofthis trip was to better understand the implicationsof long-term headwinds such as climate changeregulation, technological progress and carbon taxesfor the sector. The companies showed a range ofawareness of the issue of climate change, whichwill be incorporated into our analysis.\nPRI in Person conference\nThe second part of the trip took us to the twelfth\nPRI in Person conference in San Francisco. Thiswas held in parallel with the Global Climate ActionSummit which created an extraordinaryatmosphere.\nClimate risks were identified as the largest and\nmost material risks to investors. The conferencefeatured a keynote address from former US Vice-President Al Gore, who drew comparisons betweenthe sub-prime mortgage crisis and the climatechange crisis, and highlighted the severe potentialconsequences for investors. In addition, hepredicted that the sustainability revolution will beas big as the industrial revolution and as fast as thedigital revolution.\nAt the conference, the work of Climate Action 100+\nwas praised and the progress in this area wascommended, highlighting the importance ofcollaborative engagement and reinforcing ourdecision to be a founding investor signatory.\nMeeting with ExxonMobil\nIn November, I was grateful to be asked to\nparticipate in a group meeting in Boston withExxonMobil’s corporate secretary, Neil Hansen, andother senior employees. Each participant addressedseveral issues in line with the objectives of ClimateAction 100+ on climate governance, action anddisclosure. Overall, the meeting was constructiveand we look forward to continuing the dialogue.\nEU Action Plan for Financing Sustainable Growth\nIn last year’s report, we wrote about the High-Level\nExpert Group and I am excited about the furtherdevelopments in 2018. In May, the Commissionimplemented a number of measures that formedpart of the Action Plan. These included a proposalto create an EU classification system, also knownas a taxonomy, which will allow the numerousdefinitions of ‘sustainable’ activities to beharmonised.\nFurthermore, the proposed regulation will provide\nclarity and consistency on how institutionalinvestors, such as asset managers, insurancecompanies, pension funds and investmentadvisors, should integrate ESG factors, risks andopportunities into their investment decision-making process.Our review of 2018172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 4\n5Ruffer LLP\nThe Commission also launched a consultation to\ndetermine the best way to include ESGconsiderations into the investment advice offeredto individual clients, which Ruffer has respondedto in detail. The consultation focussed on whetherinvestment managers should also consider client-specific sustainability preferences when assessingif an investment product meets a client’s needs.\nOther developments\nAlexia Palacios joined the team in early 2018\nhaving previously worked on Ruffer’s charity teamand has brought with her a wealth of knowledge,enthusiasm and creativity.\nNow over to Alexia for her reflections on 2018 –\nhappy reading!\nFranziska Jahn-Madell\nDirector, Responsible Investment\nAlexia’s highlights of 2018\nClimate Action 100+\nThe urgent need to address climate change, and the\nregulatory and political environment in Europe,made engaging with companies on this issue apriority for our team in 2018. After initial meetingswith a number of companies, more details of whichcan be found in the ‘Engagement activities’ section,it became increasingly apparent that engagementon climate-related issues was more likely to besuccessful if it was combined with otherapproaches – such as investor statements atannual general meetings (AGMs). Therefore, Iattended BP’s AGM in May 2018, along with othersignatories to Climate Action 100+. We felt it wasimportant to make a statement to the whole boardto explain why improving governance of climate-related risks, reducing greenhouse gas emissionsand improving disclosure are importantto investors.Natural capital\nEach year, we choose an ESG topic of interest and\nhost seminars for our clients and those workingacross the responsible investment industry. In2018, we chose the concept of natural capital. Oneway of looking at the problem of climate change isthat it is a consequence of humans depleting theworld’s natural capital. If we are to preventsignificant changes to our climate, as well asreducing greenhouse gas emissions we also need toprotect and in some places replenish this naturalcapital. We hosted two events during the year,exploring both why investors should care aboutnatural capital and what they should be doingabout it. We are particularly thankful to AndrewMitchell, the Founder of Global Canopy, who spokeat both these events.\nCOP24 and the Just Transition\nThere was much anticipation in the lead up to the\nCOP24 (Conference of Parties) of the UnitedNations Climate Change Conference in December2018 in Katowice, Poland. The release in Octoberof the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange) Special Report on Global Warming of1.5°C added to this anticipation. The report starklylaid out the likely consequences of global warmingof 1.5°C and the additional damage that warmingof 2°C could cause. The backdrop of this reporthighlighted the urgency with which progress needsto be made, especially since global greenhouse gasemissions are still rising. Disappointingly, at theCOP24 the ambitions of governments were notsufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.The report reinforced our commitment to engagewith the companies in which our clients’ assets areinvested that emit significant amounts ofgreenhouse gases.\nNevertheless, there was a significant achievement\nat the COP24. An investor statement was presented172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 5\n6that reflects the commitment in the Paris\nAgreement that the transition to a low-carboneconomy needs to be ‘both fast and fair’ forworkers and communities. This notion was ofparticular significance to those present as theconference was being held in a part of Polandwhere the influence of the coal industry can still befelt. When the Just Transition statement waspresented at the COP24, it had attracted supportfrom over 100 investors, including Ruffer,representing $5 trillion in assets undermanagement.\n1This global commitment from\ninvestors was echoed when 53 governments,including the UK, signed the Silesia Declaration.\n2\n2019\nLooking forward, due to the increasing importance  \nof responsible investment to our clients and within  \nRuffer, we are excited to be growing our team  \nagain. We are hopeful that 2019 will be another  \nsuccessful year, with  further progress  in our \nengagement activities and continued  \nimprovements in the way we conduct ESG analysis  \nat Ruffer. If there are particular topics  of interest,  \nplease do get in touch.\nAlexia Palacios\nAnalyst, Responsible Investment172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 6\n7Ruffer LLPExecutive summary\nIn this report we touch on a number of\ndifferent areas.\nResponsible investment at Ruffer\nWe present how we have committed to the\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment (PRI) byincorporating environmental, social and corporategovernance (ESG) considerations throughout ourresearch and investment processes.\nCompany case studies\nWe highlight some companies we currently hold in  \nportfolios that we feel have interesting, innovative  \nor impressive ESG credentials. This year we have  \nincluded: the Ocado  Group, which  is working \ntowards reducing its food waste and carbon  \nintensity; Gold Fields,  which is striving  to improve \nits safety culture and reduce its environmental  \nimpact; Cigna,  \nwhich is improving the cost  \nefficiency of its insurance products and Toyota,  \nwhich has set an ambitious environmental \naction plan.3\nArticles\nEach year, members of our responsible investment\nteam write a number of articles on ESG topics ofinterest. In this report, we include articles on thedivestment versus engagement debate, withreference to fossil fuel companies, anddevelopments in corporate governance in Japan.More articles can be found at ruffer.co.uk.\nStewardship themes\nAt Ruffer, we take our stewardship responsibilities\nseriously as we believe this is an important part ofour duty to our clients. In 2018, our voting andengagement activities focussed on climate changeand lobbying, specifically political contributionsand trade association memberships.Voting activities\nOur voting activities have risen in line with the\nincreasing integration of ESG into our investmentapproach. The number of company meetings wevoted at has expanded significantly over the lastfew years: from 192 in 2016 to 273 in 2018, anincrease of 42%.\n4Ruffer voted against\nmanagement on 156 resolutions in 2018, comparedwith 74 in 2016, an increase both in absolute termsand as a proportion of votes cast.\n5\nEngagement activities\nWe are committed to engaging with companies on\na wide range of topics. In this report, we highlight anumber of engagements on the topic of climatechange. In particular, we focus on the companieswe are engaging with as part of the collaborativeinitiative Climate Action 100+, which includeExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and ImperialOil. We also present engagements with a numberof Japanese companies, including MitsubishiEstate and Mizuho Financial, on governance issuessuch as remuneration, board effectiveness andcross-shareholdings, and gold mining companieswhere social issues, such as workforce safety, havebeen discussed.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 7\n8At Ruffer, we interpret responsible investment as\nthe incorporation of environmental, social andcorporate governance (ESG) considerationsthroughout our research and investment processes,while behaving as active stewards of ourclients’ assets.\nAs an absolute return manager with a relatively\nconcentrated portfolio of equity holdings, weendeavour to fully understand a company’s risksand opportunities, including relevant ESGconsiderations. As we have one investmentapproach and conduct our own research, we areable to systematically integrate theseconsiderations across our research andinvestment processes.\nRuffer became a signatory to the Principles for\nResponsible Investment (PRI) in January 2016 inorder to strengthen our commitment to integratingESG into our investment approach. The PRI waslaunched in 2006 and comprises six goals, whichare voluntary and provide a number of differentways to incorporate ESG into a signatory’sinvestment approach. At the end of December2018, the PRI had received endorsement from over2,300 signatories.\n6\nThe following illustrates our commitment to thesix principles.\nPrinciple 1: We will incorporate ESG issues\ninto investment analysis and decision-makingprocesses\nWe believe ESG considerations are important\ndrivers of investment performance, representingboth sources of value and also investment risks.Therefore, incorporating these considerations intoour investment approach forms an essential part ofour responsibility to our clients. Our approachcombines integrating these considerations into ourresearch and investment processes along withactive stewardship, including engagement andvoting. We believe that investing responsibly willlead to better long-term outcomes for our clients.\nOur responsible investment team partners closely\nwith the analysts in our research team to identifyand evaluate the risks and impacts to theenvironment and society that could arise as a resultof poor management of a company’s operations.The risks associated with weak corporategovernance practices are also considered. Ourresponsible investment team participates in weeklyresearch team meetings where new stock ideas arediscussed. ESG considerations are then raised atstock reviews within the research team and withportfolio managers, as well as being included in thestock note. As ESG risks and opportunities evolve,these are raised in periodic stock reviews. ESGconsiderations are not only important in stockselection but are also factored into macroeconomicanalysis, and hence issues such as water scarcity,energy and climate change are discussed regularly.We also provide ESG training to our research andportfolio management teams on a regular basis.\nPrinciple 2: We will be active owners and\nincorporate ESG issues into our ownershippolicies and practices\nWe act as stewards of our clients’ assets and so it is\nour duty to ensure the companies in which weinvest act in the long-term interests of theirshareholders. We believe that engagement gives usan opportunity to improve our understanding ofinvestee companies, which enhances ourinvestment decisions. By engaging with a company,we are improving our understanding of thematerial ESG risks it faces, challenging itsbehaviour in relation to ESG considerations and inturn increasing its awareness of regulatory andsocietal changes. This is likely to result in superioroutcomes and returns for our clients. EngagementResponsible investment\nat Ruffer172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 8\n9Ruffer LLP\nalso lets us share our philosophy and approach to\ninvesting and corporate governance with acompany, and enhances its understanding of ourobjectives. We will engage on our own, or withother investors that share our concerns throughcollaborative initiatives.\nWe believe in the power of engagement, but we\nhave also found voting to be an effective tool ifcompanies do not respond to our requests. Wehave co-filed resolutions where we felt this was themost appropriate course of action. We take theopportunity to vote seriously as it enables us toencourage boards and management teams toconsider and address areas that we are concernedabout. More information about our voting policycan be found in the ‘Voting activities’ section of thisreport or in the ESG and voting policies available atruffer.co.uk.\nPrinciple 3: We will seek appropriate\ndisclosure on ESG issues by the entities inwhich we invest\nWe believe that it is fundamentally important for\ncompanies to disclose timely, detailed and accurateinformation, including on ESG issues, to enableinvestors to make informed investment decisions.When we have identified particular areas in whicha company’s disclosure is lacking or is of poorquality, we have raised this with the company andexplained the importance to us of improvedtransparency. We agree with Michael Bloomberg,the Chair of the Task Force on Climate-relatedFinancial Disclosures (TCFD), that ‘increasingtransparency makes markets more efficient andeconomies more stable and resilient’.\n7We have\nfrequently supported shareholder resolutionsfocussed on increasing disclosure.Principle 4: We will promote acceptance and\nimplementation of the Principles within theinvestment industry\nRuffer engages regularly with the Investment\nAssociation and we respond to consultations onregulatory changes when these are relevant to us.We are a member of the Institutional InvestorsGroup on Climate Change (IIGCC), which enablesus to encourage public policies that address thelong-term risks and opportunities associated withclimate change. We currently receive ESG researchfrom MSCI ESG Research and proxy votingresearch from Institutional Shareholder Services(ISS). We assess and review the research processand publications of these providers against ESGcriteria. We are also active supporters of theTransition Pathway Initiative (TPI) and CDP(formerly Carbon Disclosure Project).\nPrinciple 5: We will work together to\nenhance our effectiveness in implementingthe Principles\nRuffer believes in collaborative engagement and so\nhas been an active participant in a number ofinitiatives such as Climate Action 100+, to whichwe are a founding investor signatory. Thiscollaborative initiative was launched on12 December 2017 and is led by the IIGCC, the PRIand HSBC Global Asset Management. Through thisfive year global initiative, investors commit toengaging with companies to improve governance ofclimate change, reduce emissions and strengthenclimate-related financial disclosures. Thecompanies are among the most significant globalemitters of greenhouse gases, based on direct andindirect (scope 1, 2 and 3) emissions data. AtRuffer, we believe it is important to encouragedebate about broader concerns and therefore wehost seminars on ESG topics.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 9\n10Principle 6: We will each report on our\nactivities and progress towards implementingthe Principles\nSince 2015 we have published an annual ESG\nreport, which presents our approach to responsibleinvestment and stewardship activities in detail.The report includes aggregated quantitative andqualitative voting data, detailed case studies inrelation to our engagement activities, and anoverview of the engagement themes that wereprevalent throughout the year. Our researchanalysts contribute to the ESG report by presentinga selection of companies that have embedded ESGand corporate social responsibility into theirbusiness models. We also have an ESG policy,which provides additional information about howwe incorporate ESG into our research andinvestment processes. This policy, and othersincluding our climate change and voting policies,are publicly available at ruffer.co.uk. Ruffer canalso provide clients with specific information onstewardship activities and our PRI AssessmentReport, on request.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 10\n11Ruffer LLPCompany case studies\nAs an active investment manager, our in-house\nequity analysts play a crucial role in identifyingcompanies for our clients’ portfolios. We highlightsome companies we currently hold in portfoliosthat we feel have interesting, innovative orimpressive ESG credentials.\n8\nThis year we have included: the Ocado Group, anonline grocery retailer, which is working towardsreducing its food waste and carbon intensity; GoldFields, a diversified gold producer, which isstriving to improve its safety culture and reduce itsenvironmental impact; Cigna, a healthcareinsurance company, which is improving the costefficiency of its insurance products and Toyota, aglobal automotive manufacturer, which has set anambitious environmental action plan.\nOcado Group\nCompany overview\nOcado is the world’s largest dedicated online  \ngrocery retailer .9 It operates its own business in the  \nUK under the Ocado.com banner. The company  \nalso leverages its platform and technology to  \noperate Wm Morrison Supermarket’s online  \nbusiness and has recently announced a number of  \nlicensing deals with international food retailers  \nwhich will use its technology to operate their own  \nonline grocery businesses.\nOcado was formed in 2000 by Tim Steiner, the\ncurrent CEO, with the aim of revolutionising theway customers shop for groceries. Havingidentified the internet as a platform for changingthe way customers can access food retailing, thegroup has also reinvented large parts of the supplyand logistics chain. This has been done to create aneconomic advantage as its business model isestimated to be 6%-9% more operationally efficientthan the traditional food retail model.\n10Yet, the\ndisruptive nature of the business model also givesrise to a number of ESG and corporate socialresponsibility (CSR) advantages that the companyis pushing ahead with.\nESG\nIn conducting our research, we have had a number\nof discussions with Suzanne Westlake, head ofCorporate Responsibility at Ocado. Suzanne andher team look at a wide range of issues in Ocado’sbusiness including carbon emissions and intensity,supply chain issues and the prevention ofmodern slavery.\nIn 2018, Ocado published its first Corporate\nResponsibility Report. This followed the launch ofthe group’s corporate responsibility strategy (‘TheOcado Way’) in 2015.\n11The strategy is focussed on\nincreasing education and road safety, andreducing carbon emissions, food waste and foodpoverty. Ocado’s progress in this area has beenwell-received and, in 2017, Ocado won the CDP’sBest First Time Responder Award for managingcarbon efficiency.\n12\nOcado believes that the centralised nature of itsbusiness model provides advantages in areas suchas product waste, carbon emissions andplastics usage.\nFood waste\nManaging food waste is an important\nenvironmental and sustainability issue for thesector. Both the technology used and thecentralised nature of Ocado’s delivery model meanthat products can arrive at one of its centralFood poverty is the inability to afford,\nor to have access to, sufﬁcientnutritious food to make up a healthybalanced diet.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 11\n12fulfilment centres (CFCs) and be out for delivery to\ncustomers within five hours.13As a result, Ocado\nonly holds inventory based on customer orders –one day of inventory for chilled produce and threedays for ambient.\n14This results in food wastage\nstatistics that are better than the industry and alsotranslates into a direct economic benefit for thecompany. Less than 0.017% – or 1 in 6,000 – ofOcado’s food items goes to waste,\n15compared to\n0.5% at Tesco’s UK retail operations in2017/2018.\n16Ocado also works with the Waste and\nResources Action Programme charity,17which helps\nthe company to reduce waste, develop sustainableproducts and use resources in an efficient way, aswell as engaging policy makers to achieve systemicchange.\nCarbon emissions\nThe nature of Ocado’s business makes it relatively\nenergy-intensive – over 2,000 delivery vans thatrequire refrigeration (which adds weight andincreases power consumption) to keep the producefresh, four large CFCs that require lighting, heatingand refrigeration units and heavy goods vehicles(HGVs) to transport produce from the CFCs to 18distribution hubs.\n19Fuel consumption by the\ndelivery fleet remains the largest contributor,accounting for 66% of total emissions.\n20The group\nattempts to reduce these emissions through acombination of technology, its customer offeringFood waste and climate change: global\nfood waste each year generates around4.4 gigatonnes CO\n2eq, or about 8% of\ntotal anthropogenic greenhouse gasemissions. This means that thecontribution of food waste emissions toglobal warming is almost equivalent tothat of global road transport emissions.\n18and equipment redesign. Ocado’s UK retail business\nis growing at 10%-15% per year in volume terms andso absolute carbon emissions are increasing,\n21rising\nby 9.4% in 2017 compared with 2016.22However,\nenergy intensity has been falling, and in 2017 was27.6% below the 2013 base line measurement year.\n23\nMeasuring carbon intensity is not astraightforward exercise. Ocado’s own data,according to Suzanne Westlake, is distorted bythe pace of warehouse capacity increases.However, the group continues to report its carbonintensity and identify measures and changes toits operations to improve efficiency. Thesemeasures include –\n1Loki, the group’s van routing software, makes\naround four million routing calculations persecond to determine the quickest and mostefficient route to the next delivery destination,thereby reducing mileage.\n24‘Green van’ delivery\nslots enable customers to select deliveries fromvans that are already scheduled to be in thecustomer’s area. Due to this efficiency, an Ocadovan delivers £1 million of goods during a year,compared with an industry average of£0.6 million.\n25\n2Future developments around driverless electricvehicles provide the prospect of reducing directemissions further. In June 2018, Ocadoconcluded a trial in partnership with theGATEway Project, an £8 million researchproject led by the UK’s Transport ResearchLaboratory, which used electric self-drivingvehicles to deliver groceries to local residents inGreenwich, South East London.\n26\n3Ocado has invested in large double decker HGVswhich distribute 12 van loads of orders from aCFC to a delivery hub.

Attention is\ncommonly centred on issues around environmentalprotection, relations with employees and theimpact on local communities. At Ruffer, we take apragmatic approach to these issues – weacknowledge that mining is inherently risky, butbelieve that the right policies can lead to both apositive outcome for all stakeholders and a lowerrisk investment.\nGold Fields aspires to be the ‘global leader in\nsustainable gold mining’.\n33Its focus is not on being\nthe biggest, but rather the best operator. Thecompany recognises that, to be sustainable, miningmust entail value creation for a broad range ofstakeholders including employees, communitiesand investors.\nEnvironment\nGold Fields appreciates that its operations can have\na material impact on the surrounding environment,and so its management of carbon, water and172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 13\n14tailings is important. During 2017, Gold Fields\nreused or recycled 57% of the water from its miningoperations.\n34Our responsible investment team\nrecognises that the company has strongenvironmental disclosure, using frameworks suchas CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project), whichis important as it allows Ruffer to monitor the effectof Gold Fields’ operations on the environment. Thecompany has also made progress in increasing theproportion of its energy from renewables. Energymakes up 17% of its operational expenses andrenewables help protect against oil price volatilityas well as being more reliable than the local energygrid in some locations.\n35\nSafety management\nGold Fields recognises the imperative of keeping\nemployees safe. In the past, the company struggledwith a reactive safety culture, especially in SouthAfrica. However, recent changes have meant thatthe Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate(TRIFR) has almost halved, from 4.14 incidentsper million hours worked in 2013 to 2.42 in 2017.\n36\nThis has been driven by the education of theworkforce and revision of the company’soccupational health and safety policy. In particular,Gold Fields has identified behaviour based safetyprogrammes as a more effective way of embeddingchange in its day-to-day operations. Additionally,management incentives now contain a significantsafety component.\nCommunities\nGold Fields is mindful of its ‘social license to\noperate’. Across the industry, this concept hascome into focus following countless examples ofpoorly managed community engagement. Weconsider Gold Fields constructive in how itprovides value for the communities in which itoperates. For example, in Ghana in 2017, 68% ofthe company’s workforce was from local areasdirectly influenced by the mine and the TarkwaGold Fields schools complex supports more than1,500 students.\n37Additionally, across the company,\n94% of its procurement of goods and services($1.75 billion) was from the countries ofoperation.\n38More anecdotal evidence\ndemonstrates Gold Fields’ proactive approach tocommunity engagement: during a watercontamination scare in one of its African sites,rather than wait for ‘conclusive’ evidence, thecompany immediately provided bottled water tothe surrounding area to ease community concern.\n39\nPaul Kennedy, Research Director\nPaul has been part of the Research\nteam at Ruffer since 2012.

The cost of healthcare in the US is high,with the per capita spend of $10,209 more thantwice that of the UK’s $4,246.\n40In addition, access\nto healthcare in the US is not free of charge unlesssomeone is enrolled in government programmessuch as Medicare (for people over 65 years of age)or Medicaid (for those with disabilities or withincome below certain thresholds). Expensivehealthcare is therefore a reality for most of thepopulation. People have a choice: to risk livingwithout insurance, or to take private healthcareinsurance which can be costly (such as $6,896 foran individual and $19,616 for a family a year).\n41\nBefore Obamacare became effective in 2014,44 million Americans were living with no access tohealthcare.\n42Obamacare expanded the coverage of\nhealthcare through subsidised insurance, whichhelped to reduce the uninsured population to28 million by the end of 2016.\n43\nESG\nHealthcare costs\nWith such high healthcare costs in the US, Cigna’s\nmost significant business opportunity is to lowerthe cost of healthcare through improvingefficiency. As this will increase affordability toindividuals and increase access to healthcare, italso has wider benefits to society. Cigna has been aleader in bringing cost efficiency to US healthcarethrough its use of predictive behaviour analyticsand collaborative relationships with physicians,which has resulted in the company achieving theindustry leading Medical Cost Trend (MCT) for thelast six years.\n44In 2017, Cigna had a MCT of less than 3%,45versus\nan overall cost trend of 5.5% in the US.46Even\nthough the cost trend at Cigna was significantlylower than the US industry average, it was stillhigher than inflation as measured by the overallconsumer price index (CPI) of 2.1% in the US.\n47\nHowever, in 2018, Cigna announced a new andmore ambitious internal target to deliver MCT inline with the CPI by 2021. \nOpioid use\nOverdosing on opioid drugs (prescription\nmedicines containing morphine, usually prescribedfor pain relief) is the leading cause of deaths fromdrug overdoses in the US. 72,306 Americans diedfrom drug overdoses in 2017,\n48with prescription\nopioids accounting for 49,068 of these deaths.49\nBetween 2002 and 2017, opioid-related deathsincreased by 4.1 times.\n50Recognising the severity\nof the epidemic, in March 2018 Cigna announced a25% reduction in opioid use among its customers,with the company reaching this target one yearahead of its initial goal.\n51\nHealth and wellness\nCigna has conducted several health and wellness\nprogrammes, including health improvement toursin 100 cities in the US. The company has offeredover 10,000 free biometric screenings and hasmade 97% of its employees and their familiestobacco free.\n52Medical Cost Trend (MCT) is a metric\nthat measures the percentage increasein cost to treat patients from one yearto the next, assuming that beneﬁtsremain the same.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 15\n16Owing to such a strong emphasis on ESG, Cigna\nwas upgraded to an A rating by MSCI ESGResearch and named on the 100 Best CorporateCitizens List by Corporate Responsibility Magazinefor the fourth consecutive year in 2018.\n53\nRuchir Asnani, Research Director\nRuchir joined Ruffer in 2012.

However, attitudeswithin the industry are changing. One could arguethis has been consumer driven, but Toyota hasalso been proactively improving its activities inrecent years.\nToyota launched the world’s first mass-producedhybrid passenger vehicle in 1997, the Prius. Sincethen, this model has been an ever increasing focusfor the company with cumulative sales of over12 million electrified vehicles globally by March2018.\n56As a result, Toyota is considerably ahead of\nmost other companies with regards to fleet carbonlevels, with 13% less grams of CO\n2emitted/km\nversus the average of its global peers.57Alongside\ncontinuing to increase the sales of Prius models,In December 2017, Toyota announced\nan initiative dubbed the ‘ToyotaEnvironmental Challenge 2050’. Beloware the company’s six long-term goals\n55\n1 Reduce global average CO2\nemissions during operation fromnew vehicles by 90% from Toyota’s2010 level\n2 Eliminate all CO\n2emissions from\nthe entire vehicle life cycle – thisincludes emissions associated withthe production of the vehicle aswell as those emitted during itstime on the road\n3 Achieve zero CO\n2emissions at all\nplants worldwide by 2050\n4 Minimise water usage and\nimplement water dischargemanagement location by location\n5 Promote end-of-life vehicle\ntreatment and recyclingtechnologies\n6 Connect nature conservation\nactivities around the globe172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 16\n17Ruffer LLP\nToyota is building out its plug-in hybrid and fully\nelectric vehicle offerings, as well as investingheavily in fuel cell technology. Whilst a reductionof 90% is clearly ambitious, it may not be wise tobet against a company with as strong a track recordin innovation as Toyota.\nDuring the Japan team’s trip in December 2018,\nthe analysts visited one of Toyota’s main plants inAichi prefecture, where they observed the 98%automated production line.\n58It was clear\nthroughout the tour of the facilities theconsiderable lengths the company is taking tolessen the environmental impact of its plants.These measures range from some of the morestandard, such as solar panels on the roofs andextensive treatment of waste water, to the moreniche such as a special paint coating the inside ofthe factory walls, which improves air quality forworkers. 2050 may seem like a long way off for thecompany’s environmental challenge, butmanagement has set regular shorter-term targetsand continues to make incremental improvements– after all, that is ‘The Toyota Way’. MSCI ESGResearch recently upgraded the overall companyrating, ranking Toyota’s opportunities in cleantechnology in the top quartile of itsindustry peers.\n59\nWhile the company is a leader in theenvironmental space, corporate governance is anarea where Toyota could improve, in particularwith regards to its group structure and its large andnumerous cross-shareholdings. Japan has a longhistory of companies entwining themselves withother companies in their supply chain, known askeiretsu. This stemmed from the collapse ofJapan’s four major family-controlled monopolies,or zaibatsu, which dominated the industrialisedeconomy prior to World War II. During theoccupation of Japan, these commercial dynastieswere forced to dissolve and cross-shareholdingsbecame the preferred method of retaining inter-business relationships. Although there areundoubtedly some benefits of such anarrangement, in many cases the net effect is notoptimal for shareholders. There is pressurebuilding in Japan to reduce such cross-holdings,but it requires a cultural change which is unlikelyto happen quickly.\nTheo Wyld,\nResearch Associate\nTheo graduated from Durham\nUniversity in 2013 with a degree inmathematics.

Arguably, one of themost important steps in achieving this was theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) report, released in November 2014, whichconcluded that climate warming is now‘unequivocal’ and that human activity is ‘extremelylikely’ to be the dominant cause.\n60Importantly, this\nreport emphasised the link between greenhousegas emissions and climate change. As the effects ofgreenhouse gas emissions are cumulative,persistent and not localised, it is fundamental thatthis issue is considered in a global context. Theresponse needs to be international, and it must bebased on a shared vision of long-term goals andagreed frameworks that will accelerate action overthe next decade.\nThe ratification of the Paris Agreement, by 185\ncountries to date,\n61is an example of the\nco-operation required.62The first goal of the Paris\nAgreement is to limit the rise in globaltemperatures this century to, at most, 2°C abovepre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limitthe temperature increase to 1.5°C. To achieve thisgoal, greenhouse gas emissions need to besubstantially reduced; much more needs to bedone by governments and also by companies.Therefore, how companies are managing theirgreenhouse gas emissions has becomefundamental to their long-term financialperformance.\nThe IPCC report, released in October 2018, starkly\nlaid out the likely consequences of global warmingof 1.5°C and the additional damage that warmingof 2°C could cause. According to the report, globaltemperatures have, on average, already risen 1°Cabove pre-industrial levels and are currentlyincreasing at 0.2°C per decade. Therefore, it islikely that an increase of 1.5°C above pre-industriallevels will be reached between 2030 and 2052.\n63An\nincrease of this extent will have considerablenegative consequences around the world, fromice-free summers in the Arctic to species loss andextinction. Importantly, the magnitude of theenvironmental damage if temperatures rise to 2°Cabove pre-industrial levels is likely to besubstantially worse.\nThe Paris Agreement requires each country to set\nout, in its Nationally Determined Contributions(NDCs), a commitment to reduce greenhouse gasemissions and how it intends to adapt to theimpacts of climate change. Ruffer acknowledgesthat there are a diverse range of views on whatgreenhouse gas emissions reduction targets shouldbe, but we expect that the NDCs will be tightenedin 2023 to align with the pathway to meet the goalsof the Paris Agreement.\nConsidering both the greenhouse gas emissions\nproduced in the extraction, refining and processingof fossil fuels and the emissions released duringcombustion, the oil and gas industry is a significantcontributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. Asstewards of our clients’ assets, it is our duty to takeinto account all investment risks, and consequentlywe are considering these issues seriously andincorporating these risks into both ourmacroeconomic and company analysis.\nThere are a number of different approaches that\ncan be taken, reflecting the different backgroundsand beliefs of investors. Some argue that fossil fuelcompanies will never change their business modelsand so it is not possible to reconcile owning their172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 18\n19Ruffer LLP\nshares with a concern about climate change.\nMeanwhile others propose that by owning sharesinvestors have the opportunity to influence thesecompanies and be part of the transition necessaryto achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. And, ofcourse, there are options that can combine thesetwo approaches.\nAt Ruffer, we appreciate the importance of these\ndecisions for investors. We explored this in a paneldiscussion on the merits of divestment andengagement at our Charity Conference in May2018. We asked the audience some questionsduring the discussion to understand better whathas driven their views and whether this hasaffected their investment decisions. A majority ofthe attendees responded that the values of theircharities and their investment committees haddriven discussions on fossil fuel investments.\nWe will discuss divestment and engagement in\nmore detail below, and present Ruffer’s approachand view of the role fossil fuel companies playin portfolios.\nDivestment\nDivestment is the act of selling the shares of a\ncompany in response to concerns overenvironmental, social, corporate governance orethical issues. The main focus recently has beenfossil fuel companies with investors having a widevariety of motivations.\nThe predominant argument in favour of\ndivestment is that fossil fuel companies haveknown about climate change for many decades andif shareholder pressure has failed to change theirapproach over this time, it is not likely to besuccessful now. Fossil fuel companies beganpublicly accepting the occurrence of climate changeand the link between greenhouse gas emissionsand climate change in the 1990s, such as in thespeech by John Browne at Stanford in 1997, whenhe was CEO of BP America. However, it seems thatmany fossil fuel companies were conducting theirown research on climate change in the 1970s and1980s and some might have found evidence thatgreenhouse gas emissions were the most likelycause. Whilst in possession of this and otherscientific research, many companies continued topublicly deny climate change and this is used asevidence that they are not willing to change.\nThe second type of argument is based on the beliefs\nor values of investors. This can be driven byenvironmental or societal concerns, or religiousvalues. Both the Church of England and theCatholic Church, through Pope Francis’ encyclicalLaudato Si, have stated the importance ofaddressing the moral issues, primarily concerningintergenerational justice, raised by climate change.Some investors have made the decision thatcontinuing to invest in companies that have hadsuch a significant impact on climate change isirreconcilable with their moral values.\nThe third type of argument is based on the\neconomic risks of continuing to invest in fossil fuelcompanies. To achieve the goals of the ParisAgreement, society needs to reduce its emissions ofgreenhouse gases considerably and so it is likelythat the consumption of fossil fuels will need tofall. Consequently, there is a risk that fossil fuelassets will not be able to earn an economic returnfor their entire useable life, and hence are oftenreferred to as ‘stranded assets’. This can happen fora number of reasons including regulatory,economic or physical changes and is particularlyimportant for conventional fossil fuel assets due tothe length of their useable lives.\n64These concerns\nare intensified by the legal risks to fossil fuelcompanies, as demonstrated by the on-goinglawsuits in the US, and the risk of furtherintergovernmental responses.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 19\n20While these arguments are all important and play a\nsignificant part in the debate about whether tocontinue to invest in fossil fuel companies, thereare other factors that also need to be considered.Firstly, divestment is only possible once. While itcan be used to make a statement which is likely togain the attention of fossil fuel companies, once theshares have been sold, it is often no longer possibleto be involved in discussions with these companies.Secondly, there is an argument that by selling theshares and depressing the share price, otherinvestors without these concerns will be able topurchase shares at a lower price, allowing them toincrease their profit while the business models ofthe companies remain unchanged. These are themain arguments in favour of engagement.\nEngagement\nEngagement is the process of continued dialogue\nwith a company and other relevant parties with theaim of influencing their behaviour in relation toenvironmental, social or corporate governancepractices. Investment managers and asset owners,along with many environmental groups, have beenengaging with fossil fuel companies about climatechange for a number of years. The concerns raisedabout the success of engagement with thesecompanies cannot be dismissed. However, in thelast few years there have been developments thatsuggest engagement could now be a powerful toolfor effecting long-lasting change.\nFirstly, as concerns about climate change have\nintensified around the world, the desire to engagewith companies on these issues has grown. Thishas led to the launch of a number of shareholderinitiatives, including most recently Climate Action100+. Through this five-year global initiative,investors commit to engaging with the 100 largestcorporate greenhouse gas emitters to improvetheir governance and disclosure and to reducetheir emissions. At the end of December 2018,more than 320 investors representing over $32trillion of assets had signed up.\n65The scale of this\ninitiative gives considerable power to investorsand most companies have so far respondedpositively. This creates a valuable opportunity toexert continued pressure on companies to aligntheir business models in order to successfullytransition to a low-carbon economy. Rufferbelieves in the power of collaborative engagementand so has been an active participant in this and anumber of other initiatives.\n66\nSecondly, the support of organisations such as CDP(formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and theTransition Pathway Initiative has given investorstools and quantitative analysis to use as the basisfor meaningful engagement with companies.\nThirdly, academic research in this area has started\nto identify how to make engagement moresuccessful and the mechanisms by which it cancreate value for both investors and companies.\n67A\nnumber of these findings have been incorporatedinto the structure of collaborative initiatives suchas Climate Action 100+, and we are hopeful thiswill lead to increased success.\nWe are encouraged by the actions of some\ncompanies. For example, after increasedshareholder engagement on climate change overthe last few years, Royal Dutch Shell announced inNovember 2017 its commitment to reducing thenet carbon footprint of its products by around 20%by 2035 and 50% by 2050.\n68In December 2018,\nafter numerous discussions with investors, thecompany announced a further commitment to setshort-term targets and link these to executiveremuneration. This announcement wasparticularly heartening given the amount ofprogress made in a relatively short time, whichgives us reason to be optimistic as to what172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 20\n21Ruffer LLP\nengagement could achieve at other companies in\nthe coming years.\nThere will be some instances in which companies\ndo not respond in the desired way to engagement.However, in this situation divestment is not theonly option. Shareholder resolutions have beengaining increasing importance in recent years,most noticeably at ExxonMobil. In 2016, Ruffervoted for a climate change related shareholderresolution at ExxonMobil co-filed by the New YorkState Common Retirement Fund and the ChurchCommissioners for England. Although it failed towin the support of a majority of shareholders in2016, a similar resolution was filed in 2017. Thesecond resolution was successful, with 62.1%shareholder support, despite not receiving thebacking of ExxonMobil’s board.\n69The resolution\nasked the company to report annually on howtechnological advancement and internationalclimate change policies focussed on keepingtemperatures well below 2°C will affect its businessand investment plans. This resolution led toExxonMobil producing its first Energy and CarbonSummary Report in 2018 analysing scenarios thatlimit the increase in temperatures to 2°C, whichhas formed the basis for further engagement withthe company.\nPortfolio approach\nAt Ruffer, we have had periods with minimal or low\nexposure to fossil fuel companies, but at themoment we do hold a number of energy-relatedcompanies. This is based on a shorter-term view ofa likely cyclical recovery in energy markets assupply and demand dynamics come back in line.Our investments are concentrated in companiesthat either offer high dividend yields, which webelieve can be sustained at lower oil prices, orcompanies whose business models offer significantexposure to rising energy prices. These investmentsalso have an important role in portfolios as theyprovide exposure to continued global economicgrowth and protection in the scenario we most fear:rising global inflationary pressures.\nWhile we take very seriously the environmental\nconcerns and work to systematically incorporateenvironmental, social and corporate governanceconsiderations into our investment process for allcompanies, we think that fossil fuel companies willcontinue to provide a significant proportion ofglobal energy for the foreseeable future andtherefore will need to be part of the transition toa low-carbon economy. We believe that thecurrent pace of this transition provides time forthese companies to alter their business models,but we remain alert to changes in the pace ofthis transition.\nThe International Energy Agency’s analysis and\nscenarios add weight to this argument. In 2016,81% of world energy came from coal, oil and gas,while only 2% came from solar and wind.\n70\nRenewables are growing at a considerably fasterrate than fossil fuels, but even in the mostambitious scenarios, which reach the goals of theParis Agreement, oil and particularly gas will stillprovide a significant proportion of our energyglobally in 2050. There are some areas in which itis incredibly difficult to substitute oil or gas forrenewables, such as aircraft fuels and heatgeneration for manufacturing processes. Inaddition, oil is used as a feedstock in many otherprocesses. This is why we think that engagement isso important, as we need to encourage thesecompanies to adapt their business models and be apositive force for change.\nRuffer’s ability to construct segregated portfolios\ngives us the flexibility to incorporate client-specificethical investment restrictions into themanagement of portfolios. We currently use MSCI172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 21\n22ESG Research as our screening and research\nprovider, and this allows us to include restrictionsin relation to fossil fuel companies if desired. Oneadvantage of a segregated portfolio is thetransparency it provides, and this gives comfort toour clients that we are investing in line with theirethical investment restrictions.\nAt the end of the panel discussion at our 2018\nCharity Conference, we asked the audience someadditional questions. A majority of the respondentsagreed that engagement can have a positiveinfluence on companies and that an approachcombining both divestment and engagement ismost appropriate. These results confirmed to usthat our current approach is in line with the viewsof our clients.\nConclusion\nAs we have discussed, our view is that investors do\nnot need to choose either divestment orengagement, as there are ways to combine bothapproaches. Some investors have adopted theapproach of committing to engage for a set numberof years but if companies haven’t achieved certaintargets by the end of this period, they will divest.This approach can be particularly powerful if thetime-line is shared with companies. However, thetime taken to effect real change must be consideredwith some academic papers finding thatengagement takes on average 1.5 years to besuccessful.\n71Another alternative is to divest from\ncompanies that extract oil from oil sands orproduce thermal coal. These fossil fuel companiesare among the worst carbon emitters and theirproducts are much more carbon intensive thanother types of oil and gas. In addition, the decisionof whether to divest or engage does not have to beapplied to the whole industry. There is dispersionin both the achievement and commitment of fossilfuel companies with regard to these changes, andso engagement is more likely to be successful withsome than with others.\nThere are a number of alternatives available to\ninvestors, which can be tailored to their specificconcerns. The pace of change in this area isexciting, and there is considerable momentumwhich has already led to some significantcommitments by fossil fuel companies. There isstill much work to be done, but we think thatengagement through collaborative initiatives is thebest way to encourage fossil fuel companies toadapt their business models to align with thetransition to a low-carbon economy and achievethe goals of the Paris Agreement.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt1  28/03/2019  12:24  Page 22\n23Ruffer LLPCorporate governance\nin Japan\nDo events in 2018 demonstrate\nmeaningful change?\n2018 saw both another major corporate\ngovernance scandal and the revision of thecorporate governance code in Japan. We discussthe areas in which significant change has beenachieved, and those in which there is still morework to be done.\nThe corporate governance scandal that erupted at\nNissan in 2018 captured headlines around theworld and with memories of scandals at Toshibaand Kobe Steel still fresh in people’s minds, ledmany to question whether anything had reallychanged in Japan. However, 2018 also saw therevision of the Japanese corporate governancecode and a marked increase in support forshareholder proposals. Improving corporategovernance in Japan has been a priority for thegovernment in recent years, as a mechanism toenhance balance sheet efficiency and capitalallocation decisions with the aim of increasingcorporate value and ownership byforeign investors.\nRuffer has invested in Japanese companies for over\na decade and good corporate governance practicesare something we take seriously. While real changetakes time, with inevitable setbacks along the way,we believe there has been a meaningful shiftin Japan.Improvements in corporate governance areundoubtedly difficult to measure, but recent trendsin important indicators show progress has beenmade, albeit from a low starting point. Of allJapanese listed companies, the number with atleast two independent directors has increased from22% in 2014 to 91% in 2018, and companies whereat least a third of the board are independent hasincreased from 6% to 34% over the same period.\n72\n% of companies with independent directors\nSource: TSE from Japan Exchange Group: Progress on Japanese Governance\nReforms, p14\nIn most developed countries, it is expected that the\nmajority of directors on a board are independent toprovide a robust counter-balance to, and effectiveoversight of, management. However, the Japanesecorporate governance code only recommends thatFollowing the introduction of the\nstewardship code in Japan in 2014,Japan’s ﬁrst corporate governancecode was released on 1 June 2015 andrevised on 1 June 2018. The codefollows a principles-based approach,similar to the UK corporategovernance code, where companiesmust comply with the principles setout in the code or provide anexplanation for not doing so.\n2248808891\n612232734\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nTwo or more At least one-third of Board172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 23\n24companies appoint at least two independent\ndirectors to the board, while acknowledging that ifa company believes that having at least a third ofits board made up of independent directors isbeneficial, it should appoint them. This is still along way off the expectations of other corporategovernance codes, including the UK code, andwhat is considered best practice in many countries.Therefore, while there has been a considerable risein the number of companies where at least a thirdof the board members are independent, we wouldhope this figure will continue to increase in theyears ahead.\nThe reform of the corporate governance code in\n2018 made more substantial amendments in anumber of important areas. One of these is genderdiversity, which is particularly important in Japandue to its population demographics: the countryhas the world’s oldest and most rapidly shrinkingpopulation.\n73As the Japanese workforce is\npredicted to fall sharply in the next few decades,Prime Minister Abe has made femaleempowerment a priority since 2013 in his efforts torevitalise the Japanese economy. However, genderdiversity continues to be an issue on boards, withthe percentage of female directors increasing fromjust 1.7% in 2014 to 4.1% in 2018.\n74In response,\nthe revised code specifically references genderdiversity for the first time, as part of a broaderpush to increase diversity. Although the statisticsare more encouraging when only the largestJapanese companies are considered, the chartbelow shows that much more still needs to be doneand so investors, like us, should continue to putpressure on companies to do so.Proportion of female directors\nSource: Gender Equality Bureau from Japan Exchange Group: Progress on\nJapanese Governance Reforms, p42 and Hampton-Alexander Review, 2018Report, p44. Proportion of listed companies in Japan and FTSE 350companies in the UK\nAnother important area, which is of particular\nsignificance in Japan, is the continued existence ofcross-shareholdings.\nOf the companies in the MSCI ACWI index that\nhold cross-shareholdings, 72% are Japanese.\n75The\nrevised code states that companies should nowassess these holdings on an annual basis, takinginto account their cost of capital. Including the costof capital in the code has already had a markedeffect on companies, moving it from a largelyignored concept to one in which most nowrecognise its significance. This has broaderimplications as research shows that it is a key areaof importance for shareholders which has, untilnow, often been ignored by companies. This couldtherefore lead to the better alignment ofmanagement performance indicators inremuneration policies with investors’ expectationsin the future. 18 shareholder resolutions relating tocapital efficiency were filed in Japan in 2018, a1.72.6 2.93.7 4.117.421.923.024.526.7\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\n% of total Board in Japan % of total Board in the UK\nCross-shareholdings are the reciprocal\nholdings of equity positions whichare often held to strengthen long-term business relationshipsbetween companies.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 24\n25Ruffer LLP\nsignificant increase from 11 in 2017, demonstrating\nthe importance of this issue to investors.76\nTakeover defence measures, including ‘poisonpills’, are still common in Japan.\nMany of these controversial measures were\ninstigated in response to the perceived threat ofhostile takeovers from foreign companies in themiddle of the last decade. However, consensusopinion has changed dramatically in recent years,initially led by foreign investors but more recentlyalso supported by domestic investors. Theirconcerns are that these measures are not the bestway to protect the interests of minorityshareholders and instead are being used to protectunderperforming management teams andtherefore hinder the maximisation of corporatevalue. Initially, pressure was applied to put thesemeasures to a shareholder vote on a regular basis,but feedback from investors also led to them beingdropped by a number of companies, includingTakeover defence measures can take a\nnumber of different forms. Often thesemeasures allow the company to issuestock warrants, which have the effect ofdiluting the ownership of the companypursuing the hostile takeover. Thismakes a takeover more expensive andtherefore reduces its likelihood.Panasonic and Yamaha Motor. At Ruffer, we have\nengaged with a number of companies on this issueand have predominantly voted against takeoverdefence measures at company meetings.

We will continue to raiseour concerns and stress the importance we attachto strong corporate governance practices in ourengagement with companies, which will alsoinform our voting at company meetings.51.3\n45.851.672.580.589.686.481.4 82.184.5\n2014 2015 2016 2017 2018\nDomestic investors Foreign investors172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 25\n26At Ruffer, we take our stewardship responsibilities\nseriously as we believe this is an important part ofour duty to our clients. Although we consider theESG considerations of each company separately,each year there are themes, often reflectingindustry trends, that influence our voting andengagement activities at a number of companies.In 2018, these themes were climate change andlobbying, specifically political contributions andtrade association memberships.\nClimate change\nFor companies that make a significant contribution\nto global greenhouse gas emissions, we areengaging with management to encourage them toadapt their business models to align with thetransition to a low-carbon economy. We alsoappreciate the significance of discussing with thesecompanies the importance of greater transparencywith regards to climate-related disclosure as wellas tangible targets for reducing greenhousegas emissions.\nAs concerns about climate change have intensified,\nthe desire to engage with companies on this issuehas grown. Due to the scale and global nature ofthe problem, a number of shareholder initiatives,including Climate Action 100+, have beenlaunched. We believe in the power of collaborativeengagement and were a founding investorsignatory to this initiative, as well as being amember of the Institutional Investor Group onClimate Change (IIGCC). By becoming a signatoryto Climate Action 100+, we acknowledged in oursign-on statement, that we ‘are aware of the risksclimate change presents to our portfolios and assetvalues in the short, medium and long-term. Wetherefore support the Paris Agreement and theneed for the world to transition to a lower carboneconomy consistent with a goal of keeping theincrease in global average temperature to wellbelow 2°C above pre-industrial levels’.\n77\nAs part of Climate Action 100+, we are activelyinvolved in the working groups engaging with anumber of European and American companies. Forthose companies in which our clients’ assets areinvested that are not part of the Climate Action100+ initiative, we are continuing to engage on awide range of climate-related issues that we deemimportant.\nWe are supportive of the IIGCC’s shareholder\nresolution subgroup and we think that shareholderresolutions are likely to have an increasinglyimportant role to play in the years ahead. We seeshareholder resolutions as a useful communicationtool when engagement has not been successful as itgives companies a clear picture of the preferencesof their shareholders.\nLobbying\nWhen analysing a company, we think it is prudent\nto understand the internal governance processesaround its political contributions and its tradeassociation memberships. This is an importantissue given the effectiveness of some tradeassociations in lobbying governments around theworld, particularly in relation to climate changeregulation. It is important to Ruffer that acompany’s policy on climate change is aligned withits lobbying activities and practices. In 2018, weengaged with several companies on increasingtransparency around their lobbying activities.Specifically, we asked for public disclosure ofpolitical contributions and trade associationmemberships. We also voted for a number ofshareholder resolutions asking for additionaldisclosure of lobbying-related activities.Stewardship themes172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 26\n27Ruffer LLPVoting activities\nThe 2018 aggregated voting data presented here\ncomprises our voting across Ruffer funds,institutional and private client holdings.\nWe act as stewards of our clients’ assets and so it is\nour duty to ensure the companies in which weinvest act in the long-term interests of theirinvestors.

These companies varied in size, sector andlocation from a US entertainment provider to a UKmanufacturing company.\nThe independence and competence of directors\nwas, once again, of considerable importance to usin 2018. Consequently, we voted againstmanagement on director-related issues at 18companies. The corporate governance landscapehas continued to evolve in Japan and one area ofincreased scrutiny this year was the independenceof auditors.\nRemuneration continued to be of interest around\nthe world in 2018, particularly in the US where payhas traditionally been considerably higher than inthe UK or, to an even greater extent, in Japan.

Althoughwe value immensely the contribution that the CEOhas made to the company, we felt the award wasexcessive and the requirements to achieve it werenot stretching enough.\nVoting for shareholder resolutions against\nmanagement recommendations\nThere were a number of instances where we also\nvoted for shareholder resolutions that companymanagement had recommended voting against. Asdiscussed in our stewardship themes for 2018, weengaged and voted on a number of shareholderresolutions requesting additional disclosure onpolitical contributions and trade associationmemberships. At ExxonMobil’s AGM in May, wesupported a shareholder resolution voting againstthe recommendation of management to requestadditional disclosure of the company’s lobbying-related expenditures and board-level oversight ofthis spending. We also voted against therecommendation of management at The WaltDisney Company’s AGM in March and McKesson’sAGM in July, supporting shareholder resolutions onimproving disclosure and governance of lobbying-related expenditures. We believe it is important forinvestors to understand which organisations acompany supports, and we will continue to putpressure on companies to improve disclosure andprovide greater transparency to investors. We haveincorporated this theme into our internal votingguidelines as we believe these disclosures enable usto make better investment decisions.\nOther shareholder resolutions that Ruffer voted for\nwere particularly focussed on director-relatedmatters, such as asking for the removal of specificboard members or the election of a shareholdernominee to the board.

The companyexplained that it is in the process of working on publictransparency documents. As a follow-up the companysent a comprehensive list of trade associations that itsupported in 2017.\nWith regards to the second resolution, on water-related\nrisk disclosure, we discussed the CDP Water Informationrequest in 2018. The company stressed that water is not alimited resource in Alberta and highlighted the work ithad already done to reduce water usage. The companyalso raised concerns about the quality and robustness ofthe survey. We used this opportunity to discuss theimportance of the survey to investors like Ruffer and thenegative perception of the company due to it notcompleting the survey. Given the company said it hadalready collected the data, it was our view that the addedbenefits of disclosing this information would outweighthe negatives. The company seemed to accept this pointof view. Consequently, we decided to vote against theresolution this year to give the company time to disclosethis information but informed management that wewould vote for a similar resolution next year if thecompany hadn’t made sufficient progress.\nBP\nMain activityIntegrated oil and gas\nIssue: \nEnvironmental – climate change\nA member of our responsible investment team was part\nof the group that made a statement at BP’s AGM in May2018 on behalf of Climate Action 100+.

Other issues raised focussed on the disclosureof the company’s indirect greenhouse gas emissions, BP’ssupport for third-party industry associations and atimeline for reporting that fully adopts therecommendations of the TCFD.\nIn answering our questions, BP stressed its commitment\nto make all energy cleaner and its new framework toreduce emissions, improve its products and create newlow-carbon businesses which, importantly, has the fullsupport of the board. In achieving this, BP also stressedits commitment to the Paris Agreement. As the boarddidn’t provide much more information on themethodology used to set the targets, we will be followingup with the company on this point.

The companyresponded that it uses the long-term energy insightsmodels prepared by its research partner, McKinsey &Company, to form an opinion on the future state of thefossil fuel industry. The company believes the reason forthe disconnect between the goals of the Paris Agreementand current growth in greenhouse gas emissions is due toincreasing energy demand, particularly in emergingmarkets, coupled with steady population growth. TheCEO, Soma Somasundaram, talked about the world’sdependency on fossil fuels and how there needs to be asocial shift, in addition to the significant developmentsneeded in renewables technology. We also discussed hisview on the timeframe of peak oil and the structuraldecline of the industry, which he believed to be between20 and 30 years away.\nThe CEO described how Apergy’s ESG department is\nworking closely with its strategy team. For example, thecompany is focussing its research on reducing the energyrequired in the production of its diamond driller andincreasing its productivity. The company reported it hasachieved an increase in productivity by focussingon precision.National Oilwell Varco\nMain activityOil services\nIssues\nEnvironmental and governance – climate change andboard structure\nWith regards to environmental considerations, the\ncompany has already committed to emission reductions,including the EU 2020 plan, and has aligned its practiceswith ISO standards. At a meeting in September, we askedthe company whether it had analysed oil demand profilesthat are consistent with meeting the goals of the ParisAgreement. The Head of Investor Relations, LorenSingletary, shared his personal opinion with us thathydrocarbons will be the largest part of the energy mixfor at least the next 30-40 years. He added that thecompany is focussing mainly on improving energy andwater efficiencies, as well as greenhouse gas emissionsreductions which will also be beneficial for the company’sbottom line. In addition, the company acquired abusiness to repair and build offshore wind turbines in Q22018 as it has identified technological synergies with thebuilding of oil rigs.\nThe meeting also discussed other initiatives the company\nis implementing. For example, the company has formed aglobal energy team to perform energy audits onindividual facilities. These energy audits have foundmultiple measures that can be taken to increase energyefficiency and reduce overall energy consumption andspending, as well as facility-specific reductionopportunities. Recommendations range from suggestionsas simple as cleaning skylights to allow for brighterfacilities and eliminating some artificial light use, topurchasing efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning units and improving process designs.\nDuring the meeting, we also raised concerns about the\nboard structure as four out of eight independent non-executive directors (NEDs) have served on the board formore than 13 years. The company stated that there arenot currently any succession plans in place as threeindependent directors were appointed in the last twoyears and the longer serving NEDs are instrumental todecision making at board level.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 35\n36Tenaris SA\nMain activity\nOil services\nIssue\nEnvironmental – climate change\nAt a meeting in September, we asked Tenaris whether it\nhad analysed oil demand profiles that are consistent withmeeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The companyseemed only marginally concerned about the financialimpact of the Paris Agreement on its core business anddid not specify whether it had a view on when oil demandwill peak. Despite this, the company mentioned duringthe meeting that renewables are a part of its strategy asits industrial business supplies companies in the windpower sector.\nRaul Garcia, from the investor relations team, highlighted\nthat its new steel mill, Bay City, is certified as lowemissions and customers such as Chevron andExxonMobil are requesting carbon emission reductiontargets. This is particularly interesting as it means thatthese clients are calculating their scope 3 carbonemissions even though only a small number of companiescurrently report this information. Tenaris continues toparticipate in the World Steel Association’s CO\n2data\ncollection programme.\nOctober to December 2018\nGold Fields Limited\nMain activityGold mining\nIssues\nSocial and environmental – workforce safety and energyconsumption\nWe met Andrew Parsons, Vice President of Group\nSustainable Development at Ruffer’s office in October.We wanted to understand the work that Gold Fields hasbeen doing over the last year to improve the safety of itsworkforce and reduce its energy consumption. Andrewspoke about how the industry has changed and that it isno longer acceptable for gold mining to be a dangerousactivity. Gold Fields aims to have no life-changinginjuries at its mines. With regards to energyconsumption, its second largest cost, the companyacknowledged the importance of reducing it both from aneconomic and environmental point of view. We discussedat length the measures being put in place to reduceenergy consumption and how at a number of mines it isnow more economical to use renewables than traditionalsources of energy.\nMitsubishi Estate Company Limited\nMain activityReal estate\nIssues\nGovernance – board structure, cross-shareholdings andtakeover defence measure\nWe met with members of the investor relations team at\nour office in October. This followed a number of previousmeetings where ESG issues were also discussed. Thismeeting focussed on the structure of the board and inparticular our concerns about the independence of theaudit committee, given that some members work at thecompany. We stressed how important it is that boardcommittees are fully independent in order to provideeffective oversight of management. We questioned thecompany about its commitment to further reduce itscross-shareholdings and the company reiterated its planto reduce these over the next three years. We alsodiscussed at length its takeover defence measure, apoison pill, as the company was considering whether toput this to shareholders at the 2019 AGM.

This included understandinghow management is incentivised, in particular how the172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 36\n37Ruffer LLP\ncompany’s long-term incentive plan is structured. We\nalso discussed use of capital for acquisitions and thecompany’s dividend policy. We participated in aperception study in October regarding its sales of alcohol,which the company had commissioned to betterunderstand the views of its investors and otherstakeholders. Our engagement with Altia is in its earlystages, and we expect constructive discussionsto continue.\nGRIT Real Estate Income Group\nMain activityReal estate\nIssue\nGovernance – board structure and effectiveness,remuneration\nIn the lead up to the AGM in November, we engaged with\nthe company on the independence of a number ofdirectors, the structure of the board and its remunerationpolicy. We had a discussion with the management team,including a meeting with the CEO and Head of InvestorRelations, and received a detailed written response on allproposals. In particular, we had an in-depth discussionabout a special resolution, on the issue of ‘shares for\ncash’. We expressed our concern about the level of shareissuance being proposed as a percentage of marketcapitalisation, which was considerably higher than bestpractice, and we initially voted against the resolution.However, following the discussion with us and otherinvestors, the company submitted a change to theresolution and brought the level down to be in-line withbest practice. Consequently, we changed our vote tosupport the resolution. We also encouraged the companyto engage at this level of detail with ISS to make thevoting analysis clearer in the future.ExxonMobil Corporation\nMain activityIntegrated oil and gas\nIssue\nEnvironmental – climate change\nRuffer participated in a Climate Action 100+ group\nmeeting with ExxonMobil’s corporate secretary, NeilHansen, and several company representatives.\nIssues reflecting the initiative’s core objectives of\nimproving governance, reducing emissions andincreasing disclosure were addressed in a three hourmeeting in Boston in November. On the governance ofclimate change risks and opportunities, we encouragedthe company to disclose additional information on howthe board is gathering relevant information, whether thetopic of climate change is included as a key performanceindicator to determine the CEO’s pay and whether thecompany is intending to publicly support the TCFD.Another topic discussed at length was what proceduresthe company has in place to monitor its lobbying activitywith regards to climate change.\nIn terms of improving disclosure, the group provided\nfeedback specifically on the scenario analysis provided byExxonMobil, including concerns about its reliance on theStanford study rather than the International EnergyAgency’s scenarios. We highlighted that investors wouldalso appreciate more detail on how scenarios would affectthe company’s assets, as this was particularly vague inthe report.\nOverall, we felt that the meeting was constructive.\nExxonMobil however remained resistant to pressure todisclose targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions inline with the Paris Agreement, focussing on both thecompany’s operations and its products. This caused thelead investors of the Climate Action 100+ working groupfor ExxonMobil, New York State Common RetirementFund and the Church Commissioners for England, to filea shareholder resolution. The resolution asks ExxonMobilto disclose short, medium and long-term greenhouse gastargets that are aligned with the Paris Agreement.Importantly, this reporting should include informationabout the company’s operations and its products. As weagree with the importance of this additional disclosure,we co-filed this resolution in December.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 37\n38Fujitsu Limited\nMain activity\nInformation and communications technology\nIssue\nGovernance – remuneration\nWe met with the CFO in November where the company’s\nstrategy along with remuneration for senior managementwas discussed.

We will follow up on these points at thenext meeting.\nOcado Group\nMain activityOnline grocery retailer\nIssue\nGovernance – remuneration\nWe met with the Chair of the remuneration committee of\nOcado at our office in November to discuss theremuneration policy the board is likely to propose at the2019 annual general meeting. The current remunerationpolicy expires in May 2019. We discussed at length thecomplexities of designing a remuneration policy thatmotivates the management team to achieve the deliveryof the strategy while also attracting new people to agrowing global business, and on the quantum of the pay-outs in different performance scenarios.Imperial Oil Limited\nMain activityIntegrated oil and gas\nIssues\nGovernance and environmental – political lobbying andclimate change\nFollowing the meeting with Imperial Oil in Calgary in\nSeptember, we arranged a follow up call with thecompany in December along with other members of theClimate Action 100+ working group to discuss theprogress made so far. We were encouraged that ImperialOil had announced its intention to align boardmanagement oversight with the recommendations of theTCFD, however, the company stated it would not endorsethe TCFD more formally at this point. We also followedup on the topic of political lobbying but there has notbeen much progress on this. We will continue to putpressure on the company to improve its disclosure of theorganisations it supports and provide greatertransparency to investors.172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 38\n39Ruffer LLP\nAGM Annual General Meeting\nAiming for A A collaborative shareholder engagement initiative on climate change; the ‘A’ in\nAiming for A refers to the best A-E CDP performance band.

We look after investments forprivate clients, institutions and charities, in the UKand internationally. As at 31 December 2018, wemanage over £20.9 billion and employ over 270people, with offices in London, Edinburgh andHong Kong.\nOur investment approach\nOur distinctive investment approach is focussed on\ndelivering positive returns, regardless of howfinancial markets perform. Our two investmentobjectives are\n– not to lose money in any rolling twelve-\nmonth period\n– to grow funds at a higher rate than would be\nachieved by depositing them in cash\nTo do this, we conduct our own research, actively\nmanage investments, and operate freely, withoutthe restrictions that come fromfollowing benchmarks.\nWe invest predominantly in conventional assets as\npart of an investment approach that isconservative, tried and tested.\nSince we started in 1994, we have broadly achieved\nour objectives, shielding our clients from themarket crashes and generating returns well aheadof cash.\nLooking ahead, if we can continue to meet our\nobjectives over the medium-term, we will increasethe real value of our clients’ assets.\nWhat’s more, our returns should come with lower\nvolatility and risk than an investment strategyinvested mostly in equities.How we invest\nWhen creating portfolios for clients, we seek to\nstrike a balance between investments that shouldprosper when financial markets are favourableand those that provide shelter duringmarket downturns.\nThe investments we hold for favourable conditions\nare often equities, and we think of them as growthassets. Those providing shelter are our protectiveassets, and they are usually a combination ofconventional and index–linked bonds, currencies,commodities and derivatives.\nTo avoid being dependent on the direction of\nmarkets, we always hold growth and protectiveassets alongside each other, varying the allocationto each over time.\nOur investment team\nOur investment strategy and asset allocation are\nset by Henry Maxey (Chief Investment Officer),Jonathan Ruffer (Chairman) and Jon Dye (Head ofResearch), with input from senior portfoliomanagers and our in-house researchers. Thisinvestment strategy team brings together a rangeof complementary skills and contrastingperspectives on the financial markets and theglobal economy.\nWhen the asset allocation has been set, our\nresearch team finds appropriate securities tofulfil it. The team is given the task of finding thebest investment opportunities from around theworld and is not constrained by narrow sector orcountry boundaries. While many of the ideas flowfrom the asset allocation, some are stock-specific,when we identify an attractive, improving orundervalued company.About Ruffer172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2_172361 Ruffer ESG Report Pt2  28/03/2019  12:25  Page 43\n44Contact us\nFranziska Jahn-Madell\nDirector, Responsible Investmentfjahn-madell@ruffer.co.uk+44 (0)20 7963 8200\nJoined Ruffer in 2014 after working\nfor 10 years at EIRIS, a research provider forenvironmental, social and governanceperformance, in several positions.

Students are striking, \nextinction rebellions are shutting down our cities, \nGreta Thunberg is being granted audiences with the \nmost senior politicians and the Greens are making \nunprecedented inroads at the European Parliament. \nWe have long viewed public pressure as an  \nimportant piece of solving the climate puzzle.  \nOur Climate Progress Dashboard tracks the level of \npublic concern about climate change by using Gallup’s \nannual survey on the attitudes of major countries to \nclimate change. We assume that if 90% of respondents \nare concerned about climate change, the rise in global \ntemperatures will be limited to 2°C. If only 10% are \nconcerned, we will see a 6°C rise. The last dashboard \nforecast a temperature rise of 3.3°C, flat from when the \ndashboard first launched in 2017. It will be interesting \nto see if this important indicator starts to shift. If it does, \npolicy programmes like the much discussed Green \nNew Deal in the US may start to change the investment \nlandscape. We unpack this, what it is, and how  \ninvestors should think about it. \nWell over a decade ago we identified climate change \nas a major headwind that all investors would have to \nnavigate over the long term. The complexity of the \nchallenge and the multi dimensional scope means \nthat the historic tools investors have relied on are of \nlittle use; but the benefits for those who understood \nthe implications would be substantial. This quarterly \nupdate provides insight into how the story is unfolding \nso far. We discuss how industries ranging from fashion, \nto aviation, to waste, will be transformed, creating new \nwinners and losers.\nWe believe that engagement and improved corporate \nreporting on ESG issues, including climate change,  \nis another important piece of the puzzle.  However, we are aware that we are asking more of \nour investments than ever before, and run the risk of \noverwhelming companies with an endless list of asks. \nWe take stock of the current state of engagement, \nand set out some important markers for the future. \nMeanwhile, in Thinking Fast and Slow on Corporate \nGovernance, we attempt to strip governance back to \nthe essentials and encourage boards to think how \nthey can effectively focus on minority protection, \nbusiness and strategic oversight and demonstrate \nhow companies that do this generate alpha. \nFinally, given the long term structural nature of climate \nchange, it is important that investors don’t just consider \nthe impacts on a company or sector level, although as \nwe have demonstrated with tools like Carbon Value \nat Risk, these can be substantial. In the second of our \npapers of Multi-Asset Investing and ESG integration \nwe stress the importance of asset owners considering \nclimate change impacts when it comes to their strategic \nasset location decisions, as well as taking a total \nportfolio approach to sustainability. We hope that this \nreport goes some way to demonstrate how we are \nseeking to take a similar total firm approach. \nMany of these pieces are summaries of longer pieces  \nof work.

Frustrated at the same \nunacceptably sluggish action on climate change we \nhighlight in our Climate Progress Dashboard, Thunberg \nnonetheless cut a lonely figure. A self-proclaimed \nintrovert, it seems unlikely that Thunberg would have \nenvisaged that six months later, around 1.6 million \nstudents would protest her cause around the world.\nThe “Fridays-for-Future” movement initiated by Thunberg \nresulted in over 2,000 protests in 125 countries in a single \nday, demonstrating the increasing demand for solutions \namong younger people. The recent “Extinction Rebellion” \nprotests in several European cities included protesters \nsupergluing themselves to trains, trucks, and buildings. The 10-day protest was another more forceful,  \nlarge-scale call for political action.\nAs climate change investors, we believe the theme \nwill disrupt real businesses and every day life faster \nthan most investors appreciate. The costs of taking \naction on climate change have fallen faster than many \nexpected and the benefits of addressing climate risks \nhave become clearer. This has prompted more and \nmore people to forego self-interest and act at the \npersonal level for real change. No longer a “worry \nfor tomorrow”, climate change is already affecting \nconsumer habits, influencing company profitability \nand changing corporate behaviour.\n2\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nThe language of change:  \n“flygskam” and “tagskryt”\nThunberg’s European tour to carry her messages \non climate change took place in London, Rome and \nStrasbourg. When travelling, the activist shunned \nplane travel completely in favour of trains. By choosing \nthe train, she saved about 400kg of CO2, or a tenth of \nthe average Swede’s annual carbon emissions.\nThunberg’s flight-free tour comes a month after the \nWWF released a survey which showed that almost a \nquarter of Swedes have opted out of air travel over the \npast year to reduce their climate impact. The strength \nof the flygskam (flight shame) movement on travel \npatterns shouldn’t be underestimated. The trend has \nalso seen the rise of another buzzword to express pride \nin avoiding air travel, tagskryt, or “train-bragging”.\nIndeed, Sweden’s airline and airport operators have \nseen passenger numbers decline whilst rail operators \nhave seen their numbers boosted.\nThe companies facing the sternest climate \nchange threat\nHeartened by signs of increased awareness about \nclimate change, we are of course also keenly  \ninterested in how low-carbon lifestyle changes  \naffect different corporate sectors.\nAviation is a sector that will be incredibly tough  \nto decarbonise. Batteries and fuel cells are unlikely  \nto work in aircraft except over short distances. Longer \nterm, the fossil fuels powering planes will probably \nhave to be replaced with biofuels and synthetic fuels; \ntechnologies that are currently expensive and scarce. \nHowever, demand management can also play a role, \nand this is where flygskam comes in.\nShifts in transport modes and logistics efficiency  \ncould reduce carbon emissions from heavy-duty \ntransport (including aviation) by 20%1, according  \nto an Energy Transitions Commission report looking  \nat decarbonising hard-to-fix sectors. The move from \nplane to rail for short-haul passenger trips, on a  \nkg/km basis, reduces carbon emissions by 85%2.\nThe report advocates investment in railways and \nfinancial incentives for consumers to help drive the \nchange. However, normative shifts like the flygskam \nmovement can be very powerful too. From an \ninvestment perspective, we are particularly interested \nin the tagskryt side of the coin, and see tremendous \npotential from the growth of rail travel and rail freight.  \n1 Hoikkala, H. & Magnusson, N., “As ‘Flying Shame’ Grips Sweden, SAS Ups Stakes in Climate Battle”, Bloomberg, 14 April 2019\n2  Orange, R., “Greta Thunberg's train journey through Europe highlights no-fly movement”, The Guardian, 26 April 2019Fewer flyers \nPassenger numbers at Swedavia’s airports have declined \nfor seven months\n-8-6-4-20246810\n2017 2018 2019%\nChange in total passengers, year on year\nSource: Hoikkala, H. & Magnusson, N., “As ‘Flying Shame’ Grips Sweden, \nSAS Ups Stakes in Climate Battle”, Bloomberg, 14 April 2019\nSteaming Ahead \nPassenger numbers at Swedish train operator SJ jumped \nto a record last year\n0510152025303540\n2016 2017 2018million\nSource: Hoikkala, H. & Magnusson, N., “As ‘Flying Shame’ Grips Sweden, \nSAS Ups Stakes in Climate Battle”, Bloomberg, 14 April 2019\n3\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nThe five practical issues of incorporating \nESG into multi-asset portfolios\nWe discuss the five practical issues asset owners need to address when implementing  \na sustainability budget for environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations \nin multi-asset portfolios. \nIn our last paper - Managing sustainability from a \ntotal portfolio perspective - we established how asset \nowners can include a sustainability budget alongside \ntheir risk and governance budgets. How to implement \nthis at a total portfolio level is the next challenge that \nasset owners face.\nWe believe that there are five practical issues \nasset owners need to address when implementing \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) \nconsiderations across assets:\n1. Establish an overarching ESG philosophy \nthat applies across the total portfolio\nWe believe that ESG factors should be taken into \naccount to make better investment decisions.  \nThe primary impact of ESG factors is in security \nselection, but we also believe it is important to \nconsider ESG for asset allocation.\nWhen constructing a total asset portfolio, asset \nowners can position their assets on a spectrum from \nunsustainable (0%) to 100% sustainable investing. \nPositioning on this spectrum may require a trade-off \nbetween sustainability and diversification; an asset \nowner may choose to have a lower sustainability \nbudget that includes some unsustainable components \nin order to improve diversification and reduce risk.  \nThis trade-off should form part of the asset owner’s \nESG philosophy.\nWe believe it is important to understand the aggregate \nimpact of investment choices rather than a piecemeal \napproach using different metrics.\n2. Understand the effect on the total portfolio \nof using ESG asset components or removing \nasset classes that cannot incorporate ESG \nRemoving non-ESG components can be expensive \nin terms of risk because such an approach tends to \nincrease total portfolio risk and concentration risk \nin the remaining asset classes, while decreasing the \ndiversification benefit.\nBy contrast, our research suggests that replacing a \nnon-ESG component with an ESG component can \nimprove diversification and is ‘low-cost’ in terms of risk. \nIt therefore seems sensible to substitute sustainable \ncomponents into the portfolio where available because \nthis approach doesn’t tend to compromise an asset \nowner’s risk/return of sustainability objectives.3. Decide whether ESG should be applied to \nasset allocation decisions, and if so, how\nAsset allocation decisions can be categorised as either \nstrategic (i.e. longer-term, 10-30 years) or dynamic \n(i.e shorter-term, 3-12 month time horizon). For asset \nowners aiming for 100% sustainability in their assets, \nthe strategic asset allocation should incorporate ESG. \nFor dynamic asset allocation, the relevance of ESG to \nthe decision depends on the time horizon of the view. \nExtra ESG insights are more likely to influence the \nmedium-term than the short-term.\n4. Decide how ESG will be applied to the \ncomponent asset classes \nESG can be applied across asset classes, from developed \nand emerging market equities to sovereign and \ncorporate bonds as well as insurance-linked securities, \nwith varying degrees of complexity. In aggregate, and \nwhere possible though, we believe that the component \nshould be managed with a sustainable approach as this \nseeks to identify truly long-term businesses.\n5. Figure out how to evaluate the impact of \nESG consistently across the portfolio\nThe total impact of a multi-asset portfolio’s \ninvestments is the most important (though the hardest \nto measure!), to ensure it is making the best use of its \nsustainability budget. We have encountered numerous \nissues in doing so, so this is a work in progress for \nus (and the subject of a future paper). However, \nwe strongly believe that it is important to have a \nconsistent methodology across asset classes and  \nto be able to report using an ESG ‘dashboard’.\nIn this paper we consider all of these issues, providing \nour views and approach to help asset owners with the \nsame dilemmas we have faced when developing ESG \nmulti-asset portfolios.\nRead the full report: The practical considerations of \nESG in multi-asset portfolios    INsight\n4\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nThe material consequences of choosing \nsustainable fashion\nMore and more consumers are voting with their wallets to demand more sustainable \ntextiles. The shift has huge implications for one of the planet’s largest industries. \nThe textile industry – primarily the business of cloth \nand clothing – produces close to 100 million tonnes  \nof fibres every year. This number is only set to grow  \nas purchasing power in emerging markets rises.\nThe industry – and its growth - has huge consequences \nfor the environment and climate change, producing \nsome 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. \nHowever, an increasing number of consumers, aware \nof the impact that clothing choices can have on the \nenvironment, are changing their buying habits.\nFor an industry that makes $3 trillion per year in \nrevenues and employs nearly 60 million workers globally, \nthis has material consequences for investors too.\n3  Cotton Lifestyle Monitor (n.d.) as cited in Business of Fashion (2016), The State of Fashion 2017In facts and figures\n66%  66% of global consumers say they are \nwilling to pay more for sustainable goods \n– up from 55% in 2014 and 50% in 2013, \naccording to Nielsen data.\n¾  Millennials continue to be most willing to  \npay extra for sustainable offerings – \nalmost three-out-of-four respondents in \nthe latest findings, up from approximately \nhalf in 2014.\n65%  In emerging markets, more than 65% of \nemerging consumers have been found to \nactively seek out sustainable fashion3.

The \nproduction of 1 tonne of textiles generates 17 tonnes \nof CO2 equivalent, compared to 3.5 tonnes for plastic \nand less than 1 tonne for paper4.\nOver 60% of textiles are used in the clothing industry, \nand a large proportion of clothing manufacturing \noccurs in China and India, countries that rely on \ncoal-fuelled power plants. This increases the carbon \nfootprint of each garment.\nThe materials produced also has a noticeable effect \non emissions from manufacturing. It is estimated that \na single polyester t-shirt has emissions of 5.5 kg CO2, \ncompared with 2.1 kg CO2 for one made from cotton5.\nIf the industry continues on its current path, by \n2050, it could use more than 26% of the carbon \nbudget “allowed” by the Paris Accord6 to keep global \ntemperature rises to the 2°C target.\n4  Hogg, D. & Ballinger, A., “The potential contribution of waste management to a low carbon economy”, 24 November 2015\n5    This is because the former is produced from fossil fuels such as crude oil. In 2015, production of polyester for textiles use results in more than 706 \nbillion kg of CO2e\n6  Compared to the IEA 2°C pathway 2050 which allows for 15.3 giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent)\n7  World Bank, AQUASTAT, and FAO, Dataset: Annual freshwater withdrawals, total, 2014\n8  Calculation based on Circular Fibres Initiative analysis and following sources: Pakula, C., Stamminger, R., Electricity and water consumption for \nlaundry washing by washing machine worldwide (2009)\n9  Gassert, F., et al., “Water stress by country”, WRI Aqueduct (2013))\n10  Maxwell, D., et al., “State of the apparel sector report: Water”, GLASA (2015), p.43\n11  Kant, R., “Textile dyeing industry: An environmental hazard”, Natural Science, Vol. 4, 1 (2012), p.23Water\nTextiles production (including cotton farming) uses \naround 93 billion cubic metres of water annually, \nrepresenting 4% of global freshwater withdrawal7. \nCotton, while less carbon intensive than polyester,  \nis the most water intensive fibre to produce.\nBeyond production, washing clothing using washing \nmachines is estimated to require an additional 20 \nbillion cubic metres of water per year globally8.\nThe greatest challenge is accessing the water required \nin water-scarce regions. At present, many of the key \ncotton-producing countries are under high water \nstress, including China, India, the US, Pakistan, and \nTurkey9. In China, 80% to 90% of fabric, yarn, and \nplastic-based fibres are made in water-scarce or  \nwater-stressed regions10.\nFurthermore, while there is little data on ”substances of \nconcern” used across the industry, it is recognised that \ntextile production discharges high volumes of water \ncontaining hazardous chemicals into the environment. \nAs an example, the World Bank estimates that 20% of \nindustrial water pollution globally is attributable to the \ndyeing and treatment of textiles11.\n6\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nWhat are the solutions?\nThere are several ways the textiles industry can tackle \nthese problems. Fibre producers that have sustainable \nsourcing (ie. that have certified & controlled sources), \nhave “closed loop” systems avoiding waste, and have \nsustainable processing of biomass - ideally powered \nby renewable energy sources - have the best carbon \nfootprints. These “bio refineries” generate pulp, bio \nbased chemicals and energy.\nThere are also emerging innovations that change the \nway textiles are dyed in order to save water, chemical \nand energy use. Digital printing is one example.\nOne of the most effective changes could be promoting \nwood-based “cellulosic” fibre use. Synthetic fibres are \nused more than natural fibres, and of the latter, cotton \nstill leads. Cotton and polyester dominate the fibre \nmarket, accounting for 85% of all fibre used in clothing. \nCotton production is very water and pesticide intensive, \nwhereas polyester and nylon have very poor carbon \nfootprints. Synthetics are also not biodegradable.\nWood based cellulosic fibres are only 6% of fibres in \nuse today, but their use is outgrowing other fibres. \n“Modal fibres” are a type of cellulosic fibre developed \nin Japan in 1951. They are made from regenerated \ncellulose fibre.\nModal is 50% more water absorbent per unit volume \nthan cotton, and consumes less water in production. \nModal is also resistant to shrinkage, stays colour fast \nwhen washed in warm water, and is breathable and \nsilky smooth to the touch. Modal fibre is a generic \nname for viscose/rayon, which comprise 90% of all \ncellulosic fibres. Modal fibre is produced according \nto a modified viscose process and has better textile \nproperties, therefore it is a separate generic fibre.\n12  Calculation based on Circular Fibres Initiative analysis and following sources: Pakula, C., Stamminger, R., Electricity and water consumption for \nlaundry washing by washing machine worldwide (2009); Dupont, Consumer Laundry Study (2013)Lyocell is a fibre made from the natural polymer \ncellulose found in wood. It is 100% biodegradable, \nand a sub-category of rayon. It is made in a closed \nloop process, which means the water and non-toxic \nsolvents are virtually all reused.\nCellulosic fibres like lyocell and modal consume far \nless energy than synthetic fibres, and consequently are \nlower carbon emitters than the main alternatives on \nthe market. They also don’t have the water withdrawal \nissues that cotton possesses.\n Using these types of fibres could further limit the \nclimate damage from textiles or clothes through their \nlife cycle. Most life cycle emissions of clothes arise from \nthe “use” phase. If we model a scenario of 50 uses of \na cotton t-shirt, more emissions come from the use \nphase of clothing than from other activities.\nWashing and drying clothing alone is estimated to \naccount for 120 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent12. \nFast drying products – able to improve appliance \nefficiency through lower temperature washing – \ncould offer a major improvement upon the emissions \nassociated with existing fibres.\nSome fibres can enable faster drying, mainly  \ncellulose and wool blends. Home appliances are also \ngetting more efficient, which will help reduce carbon \nemissions. More recycling of fibres/extension of \ngarment life – ie. “slower” fashion and better quality \nitems – will also help.\nThe climate change impact of recycling worn out \npolyester or cotton waste into new polyester or cotton \nfibre is much lower than making the fibre from scratch. \nIn addition, the dominance of the “use” phase emissions \nmeans that if garment lives can be extended, we can \nachieve strong carbon emission savings.\nCO2 emissions, lifecycle\n2017e consumption numbers\nSynthentic ﬁbers\nOther natural ﬁbers1\nWool\nCotton\nWood-based cellulose ﬁbers2Cellulose- & protein-based fibers63.8%6.1%\n24.7%\n4.3%1.1%106mn tons\n1 Incl. bast, ﬂax, hemp, jute, silk and \nallied ﬁbers\n2 Wood-based and cotton linter-based \ncellulose ﬁbers including Viscose, Lyocell, \nModal, Acetate, Cupro…• Lyocell\n• Modal\n• Viscose\nSource: CIRFS, The Fiber Year, The Fiber Organon, Lenzing estimates. \n7\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nWhat is being done?\nTextiles is an industry that contributes close to 10% \nto global carbon emissions. We see considerable \npotential to reduce this by focusing on cellulosic \nfibres, using digital printing, and improving resource \npreservation, as well as focusing more on recycling \nand in-use emissions.\nChange, encouragingly, is looking more likely now \nthan ever. The UK Parliament's Environmental Audit \nCommittee published its proposals for improving \nthe sustainability of the fashion industry in February. \nRecommendations include strengthening the Modern \nSlavery Act, using taxation as a way to penalise \ncompanies selling products with higher environmental \nimpacts, and introducing an Extended Producer \nResponsibility scheme to reduce waste.\nThere is growing momentum in China too, which has \nfocused on building a greener supply chain within the \nfashion and textile industries for some time, via its five-\nyear plan. In January, the China National Textile and \nApparel Council revealed national ambitions to forge \na new image under three new labels “Technology, \nFashion and Green” and it specified intentions to \ntighten its grip on environmental issues.Global fibre market at a glanceCO2 emissions, lifecycle\n0246810\nCurrent\nEmissions30 degree\nwash tempLower grid\ncarbon50%\nline drying20/20\npotentialTechnical \npotentialLow carbon\nelectricityRetirement of \nless eﬃcient \nappliancesIn-use emissions (kg CO2/T-shirt) -57%\n-90%5% 15%\n10%\n27%\n33% 3.4\n0.88.0\nSource: Carbon trust\n8\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nNobody wants to see it, but it is everywhere. The \nvolume of municipal solid waste - consisting of \ndiscarded everyday items - is set to almost double \nfrom 1.3 billion tonnes to 2.2 billion tonnes by  \n2025 according to the World Bank13.\nThat growth implies an increase from 1.2kg to 1.4kg \nper person per day over the next 15 years14. Oceans \nwill contain more plastic than fish by 2050, according \nto World Economic Forum estimates, emphasizing the \nscale of the challenge15.\nRising incomes and more urban populations play a \ncritical role, accelerating the amount of solid waste \nproduced.

With \nroughly 700 million tonnes of waste generated in \nOECD countries annually16, this implies approximately \n370,000 GWh of electricity potential, approximately \n35% of which is currently sent to landfill sites17. \nTurning all this solid waste into electricity could reduce \nelectricity generated from fossil fuels in the OECD \nby approximately 6%, which is – depending on the \nfuel mix – approximately equivalent to eliminating all \ngreenhouse gas emissions of Norway, Portugal and \nthe Slovak Republic combined.

Not all \nwaste is equally suitable for generating energy of any \nsort. Our simplified example above just outlines the \npotential scale of the opportunity to extract value by \nreprocessing waste productively.\nHowever, regulators and corporates are increasingly \naware of the possibility to cut the impact upon global \nemissions significantly, and their actions, along with \nimproving technologies, provide increasingly attractive \nbusiness opportunities.\nThe field is likely to continue to evolve; technologies \nrange from traditional burning of waste for heat to \nnewer approaches like plastic eating bacteria18, with \nnew ideas continuing to emerge.

France confirmed a draft \nenergy plan that would double its renewable energy \n19  World Bank, Dataset: “What a waste 2.0”, 2018 \n20 RZ News, “France confirms draft clean power plans”, 28 January 2019\n21  Holter, M., “Tesla Mania Means Over Half of Norway Car Sales Are Now Electric”, 1 April 2019\n22 Gray, A., “China is adding a London-sized electric bus fleet every five weeks”, 26 April 2018\n23  Green New Deal website\n24  Kopf, D., “What’s a universal basic income doing in Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal”?”, 13 December 2018capacity to 113GW by 202820. Electric car sales have \ngrown to half Norway’s total21. Several Chinese cities \nhave replaced all of their diesel buses with electric \nequivalents over the last couple of years22.\nHowever, nowhere has yet put together a complete \npackage of change, nor attempted change on the same \nscale, as that proposed by the US’ Green New Deal.\nThe Green New Deal (GND) is a stimulus package \naiming at completely overhauling the US’ existing \nenergy production, manufacturing, and transportation \nsystem within the next 10 years, including sourcing \n100% renewable energy23.\nIn addition to environmental policies, the GND  \nalso targets poverty, unemployment, and inequality, \nwith included proposals ranging from re-training and \neducation programmes, to federal job-guarantees, \ninvestments focused on low-income communities \nand even basic income and universal healthcare \nprogrammes24. It implies radical change to the  \nway the US economy functions. INsight\nWhat is the Green New Deal and what  \ndoes it mean for investors? \nThe US Green New Deal is a highly ambitious project to tackle climate change  \nand inequality, which we think represents a major shift in the way investors  \nthink about climate change.\nChina electric bus sales and share of total bus salesChina electric bus sales and share of total bus salesChina electric bus sales and share of total bus sales\n020406080100120140\n2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011‘000 units\n0%8%12%16%20%24%28%32%\n4%\nPure electric bus Plug-in hybrid bus % e-bus penetration in total bus sales90\n135016\n116\n1.1 1.51.90.3 1.72.618\n1716\nSource: Weforum\n11\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nWhile unlikely to pass in its current form, the resolution \nhas so far accumulated 91 cosponsors in the House \nof Representatives25 and provided a focal point for \nenthusiastic support from large parts of civil society. \nGiven the nature and scale of the resolution, critics \nhave outlined numerous arguments as to why the GND \nin its current form would not succeed, including the \nassociated costs, its complexity, and overly optimistic \ntime horizons. Consequently, it remains to be seen how \nor if the GND will overcome the political and practical \nhurdles it must to move ahead.\nThat said, the same considerations were raised when \nPresident J.F. Kennedy announced plans to put a \nman on the moon in the 1960’s. And that project was \noptional, rather than driven by impending threats to \nthe planet.\n25  Library of Congress, “Recognizing the duty of the Federal Government to create a Green New Deal”, 7 February 2019Andrew Howard, Head of Sustainable Research at \nSchroders, believes that however it does materialise, \ngovernments will be challenging both the private and \npublic sectors to address climate – as well as many \nsocial – concerns.\n“For most of the last 70 years, companies were able \nto operate by pushing a lot of the costs created by \ntheir products, services and operations onto society. \nWe are seeing a response and a rebalancing. Since \nthe financial crisis, voters have given governments a \nstronger mandate to regulate irresponsible corporate \nbehaviour. Companies are being forced to internalise \ncosts they previously pushed onto society. More \nand more of companies’ unpriced social impacts will \nbecome priced financial impacts.”\nAs such, even if it is not the GND, a policy of similar scale \nwill have to be implemented at some stage in the future.\n12\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nGood corporate governance (CG) matters.\nYet the consensus amongst academics and \nprofessional practitioners about what ‘good \ngovernance’ actually looks like is mixed.\nThe UK is often seen as a leader in corporate \ngovernance. However, that did not stop Carillion,  \na major listed company, going into liquidation in  \n2017 following some serious CG failures.\nSimilarly, it has not meant that the UK has \noutperformed other developed markets. Indeed it has \nlagged the US whose corporate governance code is \nconspicuous by its absence.\nToo much System 1 thinking\nWe believe that part of the problem is that current \nCG assessment techniques focus too heavily on what \nDaniel Kahneman, author of Thinking Fast and Slow, \ndescribed as ‘System 1 thinking’ which comprises our \nintuition, gut-reactions based on first impressions,  \nand easy to access information.\nThe prevalence of System 1 thinking in CG \nmeasurement is clear in the abundance of long lists  \nof governance boxes to tick, codes to comply with  \nand ‘quick’ governance scores.\nWe see plenty of evidence that this System 1 \napproach does not work, from the returns generated \nby US technology companies with unconventional \ngovernance structures to the issues experienced by \ncompanies such as Toshiba, which had all the right \ncommittees, 25% independent directors and had been \nviewed as a model of good governance in Japan. \nOur System 2 assessment framework\nAs fundamental investors, we firmly believe assessing \ngovernance is worthwhile and is a factor that can \nsupport performance. But determining a framework \nto assess this in an evidence-based and relevant \nmanner is more complex than conventional scores \nand codes would have you believe. \nThe time has come for some slower thinking.\nWe believe the CG landscape needs more of \nKahneman’s ‘System 2 thinking’ and not an exclusive \nfocus on easy to access information. System 2 thinking \nis the more critical thinking used for reflection, \nproblem-solving, and analysis.Using this thinking has enabled the development of \na framework for assessing good CG that differs from \nthe approach that more traditional measures take. \nEssentially, more conventional methods focus on the \ninputs of CG, rather than their desired outcomes.\nThe starting base for the methodology of most \ngovernance scores is a local corporate governance \ncode or an international norms-based structure, which \nis used as a measuring stick against which to assess \ncompanies’ governance abilities.\nWe believe in an approach identifying the desirable \noutcomes of good CG and have distilled them down \nto business oversight (financial transparency and lack \nof controversies), strategic oversight (effective capital \nallocation) and shareholder alignment (protection \nof minority rights). We have then sought to identify \nindicators for these outcomes that have a positive \neffect on financial performance.\nOur indicators captured factors that are not recognised \nby traditional governance scores such as the likelihood \nof earnings manipulations or bankruptcy. The rise of \nunconventional data has assisted with this.\nFor example, quite often, we successfully follow \nstrong managers and directors from company to \ncompany, and vice versa. The help of our Data Insights \nUnit has been instrumental in enabling us to measure \nthe strength, expertise and track records of companies’ \nrespective boards. \nOur extensive research also indicated that \nindependent, diverse, unitary, and smaller boards \nare associated with better business and strategic \noversight. We have long been advocates of all of  \nthese things as our ESG policy and engagement \napproach has shown. \nOur research did throw up some surprises. Neither  \nthe presence of an audit committee nor its independence \nfeatured as reliable indicators of good CG. However, we \nare still advocates of independent audit committees. \nWe found that of greater importance was how the \nboard treated minority shareholders and the CEO \nbeing aligned with shareholders with shareholdings \nand the right remuneration plans. INfluence\nCorporate governance: Thinking fast and slow\nSchroders' experts, including Head of Stewardship Jessica Ground, discuss the \nimportance of good corporate governance and the company's unique approach to \nmeasuring its success. \n13\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nRather than focusing on the easiest option of linear \nbox-ticking it is best to think both fast and slow when it \ncomes to identifying best CG practice.\nThe value of investments and the income from them \nmay go down as well as up and investors may not get \nback the amounts originally invested.\nThis article first appeared in Financial News.\nRead the full report: Corporate Governance: Thinking \nFast and Slow  A more meaningful approach\nTaking distinct perspectives of CG in the form \nof business and strategic oversight, as well as \nshareholder alignment, appear to be more meaningful \nas opposed to an approach that simplifies these \nperspectives down to the lowest denominator.\nOur framework is all about combining the immediate \nSystem 1 process of simply considering traditional \ngovernance inputs as the basis for assessing CG, with \nthe slower thinking System 2 method associated with \nidentifying the desirable, but less easily quantifiable, \noutcomes of good CG.\n14\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nPAST: ESG engagement has resulted in more \ntransparency from corporates\nWhen we started recording our ESG engagements \nwith companies back in 2000, we had very little \ndisclosure from companies on a) their performance \nacross key aspects of environmental and social risk or \nopportunities and b) what management systems they \nhad in place to manage these risks. A large proportion \nof our effort naturally focused on pushing for more transparency, absent a clear view of companies’ \nperformances or the risks they faced. As demonstrated \nby the graph below, investors have not been the only \nstakeholder group pushing for greater transparency. \nHowever, the correlation between the growth in \nresponsible investment, sustainable investing news \nand signatories to the UN Principles for Responsible \nInvestment, suggests that investors can take some \ncredit for the rise in transparency.  INfluence\nThe past, present and future of engaging for \nbetter transparency\nESG engagement has grown significantly over the last few decades, most of it focused \non encouraging greater corporate transparency. In many ways, it has been successful; \nsustainability reporting has become institutionalised across large companies in \ndeveloped markets. The quality, depth and breadth of that information has improved, \nbut the progress is patchy and gaps between leaders and laggards are widening.  \nWe are shifting our efforts toward those laggards.\nRise in engagement and corporate transparency\nLimited industry penetrationRapid rise in awareness, \nlimited differentiationUbiquitous recognition, focus on \ndifferentiating strategies\n050100150200250300\n2000 2004 2008 2012 2016\nPRI signatories Sustainable investing news European responsible AUMIndexed, 2000 to 2018 average = 100\nGlobal CSR reports\nSource: Hightail (news search for articles containing ‘sustainable investing’ relative to all articles referring to ‘investing’, principles for responsible \ninvestment (number of signatories) and EuroSIF (combined AUM invested in different ESG strategies, adjusted for double-counting).\n15\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nPRESENT: We’ve achieved greater disclosure. \nNow, what do? \nInvestors may be able to claim some of the credit \nfor increased transparency from companies and \ndemonstrate active ownership and the fulfilment  \nof stewardship duties. However, there have been  \nthree unintended consequences of investors’ \nengagement efforts:\nUnequal disclosure levels across regions \nDisclosure levels vary significantly across regions. \nWe looked at engagement data from the PRI’s \ncollaborative engagement platform, the Clearing \nHouse. This repository of joint engagements by ESG \ninvestors suggests 50% of the engagements since \n2006 have been with European-listed companies26. \nIndeed, many European companies comment that \nthey are overwhelmed with surveys, questionnaires \nand data requests. \nSome sustainability topics are favoured over others\nThe same PRI study on collaborative engagements \nshows that environmental issues are the most popular \ntopic for engagement. Looking at the top ten countries \nby market capitalisation, our own analysis shows that \naverage disclosure rates on carbon emissions are \nconsistently higher than disclosure on health and safety. \nPolarisation between leaders and laggards\nThere is a danger that institutional investors continue \nto take the path of least resistance, talking to the \ncompanies they know best, on the topics they \nunderstand most about. In this way, they risk focusing \nonly on the leaders, while the laggards fall further \nbehind. Companies across all industries face challenges \non many fronts. The effects will not be dictated by \nthe topics that are easiest to measure or centred on \nthe most transparent companies, potentially leaving \ninvestors blind-sided by unexpected risks.\n26  Dimon, E., Karakaş, O and Li, X. “Local leads, backed by global scale: the drivers of successful engagement”, 2017\n27  Ethical Corporation, “The Responsible Business Trends Report 2018”, 2018FUTURE: Going beyond disclosure requests\nIn regions where corporate disclosure is more \nadvanced, reporting is moving beyond an exercise  \nin meeting investors’ demands for information. \nLeading companies are increasingly demonstrating \nhow their strategies, and risk measurement and \nmanagement, yield distinctive competitive advantage. \nTwo key trends are taking leading companies beyond \n“compliant” disclosure:\n1. Business case: Growing recognition of the  \nbusiness case for engaging with social and \nenvironmental challenges. For instance, the latest \nResponsible Business Trends Report has seen the \nnumber of companies acknowledging the revenue \nopportunities presented by sustainable investing  \nas rising from 49% to 56% in the past four years27. \n2. Accountability: Rising pressure to take greater \nownership of global social and environmental \nchallenges. At its simplest, this tends to result in \nreframing existing activities around sustainable \ndevelopment goals (SDGs). In turn, this pushes \ncompanies to consider their impacts in the context \nof societal goals rather than relative to peers. \nInitiatives like the Science-Based Targets and Future \nFit put the emphasis on companies’ exposure in \nabsolute terms rather than relative to peers. \nConclusion: close the gap and quantify \nimpacts\nCorporate transparency, reporting regulations \nand best practice have all changed significantly \nsince we started engaging with companies \nnearly two decades ago. As we look forward we \nare focusing our engagement efforts on closing \nthe gap between regional and sector disclosure \nlevels, and targeting engagement with companies \nwhich provide little transparency as well as re-\nbalancing our engagement to focus more on Asia \nand the US. We are also encouraging leading \ncompanies to adopt the “accountability” approach \nto reporting. We believe that by acknowledging \nstakeholders, understanding longer-term \nresource constraints and contributions to global \nsystems, and quantifying business impacts, will \nhelp investors to more accurately reflect the risks \nand opportunities of sustainability issues. \n16\nSustainable Investment Report\nQ2 2019\nCompany E S G\nConsumer Discretionary\n361 Degrees ✔\nABC Mart ✔\nAccor ✔\nAmazon ✔\nAnta Sports ✔\nAntena 3 ✔\nAutins Group ✔ ✔\nBMW ✔\nBooking Holding ✔✔\nBorgWarner ✔\nBrembo ✔\nBTG Hotels Group ✔\nBurberry Group ✔ ✔\nBurlington Stores ✔\nCairo Communications ✔\nCarnival ✔\nCharter Communications ✔ ✔\nCheesecake Factory ✔\nChina CYTS Tours ✔\nChina Lilang ✔\nChina Zhengtong Auto Services ✔\nChow Sang Sang ✔\nCompass Group ✔ ✔\nConsorcio ✔\nCyrela Brazil Realty ✔Company E S G\nDalata Hotel Group ✔\nDiscovery Communications ✔\nDometic Group ✔\nDufry ✔\nEZ TEC Empreendimentos ✔\nFaurecia ✔\nFerrari ✔\nFiat Chrysler ✔\nForbo Holding ✔\nFu Shou Yuan International ✔\nGalaxy Entertainment ✔\nGaleries Lafayette ✔\nGeely Automobile Holdings ✔\nGolden Eagle ✔\nGourmet Master ✔\nGreene King ✔\nSEB ✔\nGuangzhou Auto ✔\nHangzhou Robam Appliances ✔\nHenry Boot ✔\nHome Depot ✔\nHT&E ✔\nHUAYU Automotive Systems ✔\nHusqvarna ✔\nIMA ✔\nInforma ✔Second quarter 2019\nTotal company engagement\nOur ESG team had 763 engagements this quarter with the 709 \ncompanies listed below, on a broad range of topics categorised under \n“environmental”, “social” and “governance”.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is a critical \ncomponent of  this investment philosophy. We recognize that ESG considerations, such \nas board structure, environmental practices, or labor policies, can affect a company’s \nlong-term fundamental valuation. Therefore, our investment professionals integrate \nESG analysis into their research and decision-making process.  \nOur more than 275 investment professionals worldwide are responsible for identifying \nESG risks and opportunities and incorporating them into their investment analysis. Our \nresearch is documented in our internal research database and is available to all investment \nprofessionals globally. Yet, this ESG evaluation does not end once a buy or sell decision \nis made. As active investors, we strive to maximize shareholder value for our clients by \nvoting proxies and regularly engaging with companies. In this report, we provide select \nexamples from our wide-ranging ESG-related efforts.\n2Engagement \nDuring 2018, our investment professionals participated in more than 3,800 meetings with company management \nand boards of  directors. In 41% of  those meetings, an ESG issue was discussed. In many of  those meetings, the \ndiscussion was often elevated to a point where we made recommendations to management or the board because \nwe believed that their ESG practices could have a material impact on the company’s financial performance.\nCase Studies  \nRockwell Automation, Industrial Automation \nWe engaged with senior management to better understand Rockwell’s commitment to diversity and inclusion, \nparticularly since gender diversity challenges tend to be more pronounced in engineering and industrial \nsectors. As the competition for talent is becoming more intense globally and across industries, it is increasingly \nimportant to attract high-caliber candidates from a diverse pool and create an inclusive culture to retain them. \nCatalyst, a global non-profit, has shared many studies linking di versity to indicators of  profitability and financial \nhealth, including higher return on sales, return on assets, and return on equity. \nTheir efforts to date have seen the number of  women engineers increase by 38% and the number of  female \ndirectors by 65% between 2008 and 2017. \nIn addition to discussions with management, we have attended events that provided insights into the \ncompany’s ESG efforts. For example, at recent Investor Meetings/Automation Fairs, Rockwell has \ndemonstrated the importance of  diversity, inclusion, and employee engagement for itself  and its supply \nchain and distribution partners. \nWe are encouraged that Rockwell recognizes the need to build inclusion into their engineering culture so that \ntheir employees produce their best work, and we will continue to monitor their progress.Lazard ESG Engagements in 2018\nEnvironmental Social Governance\n53% 22% 25%\nEngagements for 1 January 2018 − 30 April 2019\nSource: Lazard\n3Deere & Co., Equipment Manufacturer\nWe engaged with the CEO/CFO and the Corporate Secretary/Director of  Compensation of  Deere to \ndiscuss changes in the company’s executive compensation program. As a shareholder, we believe executive \ncompensation programs should have robust performance metrics that are aligned with shareholders’ interests \nand we expressed this to Deere during our discussions. Over the past three years, we have seen Deere improve \nits executive compensation program by significantly increasing its operating return on operating assets (OROA) \nperformance hurdles and adding two new metrics, revenue and net income. We believe these changes help \nimprove the executive compensation program’s alignment with shareholders’ interests. As a result, we voted for \nits Say-on-Pay vote at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM). We also voted for the shareholder proposal \nto provide the right to act by written consent at the 2019 AGM as we believe it is in the best interests of  \nshareholders and a positive corporate governance practice.\nSociete Bic, Consumer Products\nWe engaged with the CEO, who is also heir to the founding family, to better understand the company’s \nenvironmental impact as plastic represents a large proportion of  Bic’s input cost. Consumer awareness \nregarding the impact of  plastics on the environment has resulted in a material change in the attitude \ntowards disposable plastics. This has, in turn, resulted in action from policy makers, causing manufacturers \nto re-examine the life-cycle of  their products. Having a credible sustainability policy for Bic to reduce its \nenvironmental impact is thus crucial for the long-term success of  the business. The engagement improved our \nunderstanding of  Bic’s focus on product longevity and partnership with R&D centers on innovative materials, \nwhich we view as a strength. We also noted the company’s long track record in managing down power \nconsumption and the PVC content of  plastic. We will continue to monitor the company’s progress towards the \nuse of  renewable materials and the improvement of  collection infrastructure.\n4Participation in Collaborative Initiatives\nLazard is a signatory to, and a member of, several organizations that promote responsible investing. We have \nbeen a signatory to the United Nations—supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) since 2014. \nWe are signatories to the UK Stewardship Code, the Japan Stewardship Code, and the UK Women in Finance \nCharter. We are also members of  the International Corporate Governance Network (ICGN), Pensions and \nLifetime Savings Association (PLSA), and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) Investors in \nFinancial Reporting programme. In addition, one of  our investment professionals serves on the PRI Fixed \nIncome Advisory Committee.\nLazard Asset Management London became a signatory to the UK Women in Finance Charter in June \n2018, an initiative led by HM Treasury which seeks to promote gender balance across the financial services \nindustry. Becoming a signatory demonstrates our commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion, and the \nadvancement of  women in the industry.\nWe also regularly attend and speak at industry events. In 2018, Lazard investment professionals from around \nthe world participated in several ESG-focused conferences and investor initiatives.\n5ESG Collaborative Initiatives Activity in 2018\nInitiative Date Location E S G\nSolar Wakeup Live!

Many of  these issues are sector and geography-based or relevant to \na specific asset class. Our investment professionals are encouraged to develop subject matter expertise \non ESG topics that are relevant to their investment universe. In 2018, we published a selection of  such \nthought leadership pieces on topics from green bonds, to structural shifts in the transportation sector \ndue to specific environmental issues, to a study of  Japan’s corporate governance reforms.\nGreen Bonds’ Growing Role in ESG Investing \nYvette Klevan, Managing Director, Portfolio Manager/Analyst\nThe focus on responsible investing has grown rapidly over the past decade, and it is now considered \nmainstream in many parts of  the world to incorporate ESG factors into investment analysis. Since the \nPrinciples for Responsible Investing (PRI) initiative was launched in 2006 with support from the United \nNations, more than 1,800 signatories—nearly 400 of  which manage roughly $70 trillion of  assets—have \njoined this effort. There is also increased awareness of  the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nwhich cover a broad range of  economic and social development issues. Here, we describe green bonds and \ntheir underlying principles, and explain the market for these securities as well as their issuance.  \nFrom an investment perspective, green bonds provide an option for investors wanting to navigate the transition \naway from fossil fuel investments and reduce exposure to “stranded assets,” such as coal companies. Investor \ninterest in green bonds has strengthened as various global institutions and organizations increasingly focus on \nmitigating or addressing climate change. This trend should help support strong valuations for green bonds. \nIssuance is also increasing as the “labeled” (bonds that are cer tified as green) and “unlabeled” (projects that \nare linked to environmental benefits but are not certified green) markets evolve. We believe that countries and \ncompanies that can reduce carbon emissions and adapt to, or mitigate, climate change will be better positioned \nto prosper.Growing Global Commitment to Responsible Investing\n($T)\nSignatories [RHS]Asset Owners [RHS]Total AUM [LHS]Asset Owners, AUM [LHS]\n020406080\n04509001,3501,800\n2017 2015 2013 2011 2009 2007Number of Signatories/Asset Owners\nThe green bond market is rapidly growing and evolving, but it is still in the early stages of  development.  \nA key driver of  its momentum is the increasing focus on ESG and sustainable investing on the part of  issuers \nand investors. Green bonds offer governments and companies a way to raise funding for projects that will \nsupport the transition to a lower carbon economy and more sustainable future. We believe portfolios that \nrecognize this structural change are better positioned to outperform the broad market. We believe an \ninvestment approach that emphasizes sustainability is better placed to add value in the long run. Based on our \nobservations as managers of  global fixed income portfolios, the integration of  ESG factors and green bonds \ninto the investment process can help investors reap opportunistic gains as well as defend returns.\nRead the entire paper: https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/us/en_us/research-insights/lazard-insights/\nGreen-Bonds-Growing-Role-in-ESG-Investing\nThe Growing Importance of  the “E” in ESG\nJeremy Taylor, Managing Director, Co-Chief  Executive Officer, Lazard Asset Management Limited (London) \nNathan Cockrell, Managing Director, Co-Director of  Research and Research Analyst\nAlistair Godrich, Senior Vice President, Research Analyst \nNeil Millar, Senior Vice President, Research Analyst\nEnvironmental regulation has grown in volume and stringency over the past 20 years, causing large-scale \nchanges across many industries. Pinpointing the source of  these changes and identifying the impact on specific \ncompanies and sectors is challenging, even for well-informed investors.\nThe global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has had a clear and widely recognized impact on the \nautomotive industry—namely automakers reorienting production toward electric vehicles and away from diesel \ncars. However, the effect on suppliers tends to draw less focus.\nVolume of Climate Change Laws Has Mushroomed\n02004006008001000\n2019 2015 2012 2009 2006 2003 2000 1997 1994Executive LegislativeNumber of Global Laws and Executive Policies\nAs of 27 April 2018 \nCountries use different routes to address climate change. In some countries the primary avenue is acts of parliament, i.e., formal laws passed by the legislative branch \nof government. In other countries, it is executive policies. \nSource: Climate Change Laws of the World database, Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and Sabin Center for Climate Change Law\n9The value in the supply chain has shifted away from car manufacturers towards suppliers, as automakers \nhave started to outsource the manufacture of  a growing number of  components to their supply base. \nThe increasing level of  sophistication in the technology used has meant that some parts have started to \naccount for a greater proportion of  a car’s overall value, creating economic moats for those companies that \nmanufacture or supply them.\nHowever, this does not mean that investors should simply favor the stocks of  suppliers over car manufacturers. \nIn some cases, carmakers have de-rated significantly to the point where environmental risks are being factored \ninto their share price. Spotting where the opportunities lie comes down to having a deeper appreciation of  how \nregulations alter company behavior and competitive dynamics.\nA similar theme is unfolding in the oil refining sector, as structural shifts in the shipping sector look set to \ncreate opportunities for some refiners. The shipping industry is bracing itself  for tighter sulphur emissions \nregulations, which are due to come into effect in January 2020. At present, fuel costs represent around 15% of  \ntotal costs for a shipping company, so the change in regulation is likely to have a material financial impact. \nA spike in demand for low-sulphur fuels is expected ahead of  impending, regulation which will likely result in \nshock to refiners. Capacity will be an important determinant in gauging the scale of  the impact each refiner faces.\nThe impact of  environmental regulation is likely to differ across companies, sectors, and regions, and will \nchange over time. We believe that active, bottom-up fundamental managers are better able to anticipate the \nrisks and opportunities created by structural shifts compared to other investment approaches, as thorough and \nregular engagement with company management in combination with rigorous fundamental analysis generate \nunique insights into how different businesses are developing.\nRead the paper: https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/docs/-m0-/67480/  \nTheGrowingImportanceOfTheEInESG_LazardResearch_en.pdf\nJapanese Policy Reforms\nA series of powerful policy initiatives began to take shape in 2013, when the Abe administration made corporate revitalization \na key plank in its growth strategy. The administration believed corporate governance reform was an important response to a \nnumber of challenges Japan faces, including demographic headwinds and the rise of China.\nKey Reforms Objective Progress\nThe Stewardship Code Encourage investors to engage with company \nmanagement to \"promote sustainable growth of \ncompanies through investment and dialogue.\" It requires \ninvestors, in some cases, to disclose their proxy votes \nand explain them in terms of their fiduciary duty.The Stewardship Code has improved the quality of \nmeetings with company management. However, \nproxy voting support for underperforming \nmanagement teams has remained disappointingly \nhigh through the June 2018 AGM season.\nThe Ito Review Required companies to improve their corporate value \nby setting clear performance metrics. Each company \nshould aim to generate a minimum 8% ROE. The Ito Review has contributed to a change \nin management behavior, and the structural \nimprovement in capital efficiency. However, ROE \ntargets are often not well integrated with company \nkey performance indicators.\nThe Corporate Governance Code Instructs all publicly traded companies to follow \n“fundamental principles for effective corporate \ngovernance.” Companies must explain their “policies \nregarding the reduction of cross shareholdings”and  \njustify them in relation to “the company’s cost of capital.”The most impactful of the initiatives, the Corporate \nGovernance Code has contributed to the structural \ndecline in cross shareholdings. However, adherence \nis often superficial and the pace of change varies \nsubstantially by company.\nInformation and opinions are subject to change\n10\nOur Commitment\nAt Lazard, we conduct independent ESG analysis to ensure our clients receive \ndifferentiated insights that can be critical to investment outcomes. And we go further \nby engaging with companies to advocate for positive change on behalf of shareholders. \nAs the global business environment evolves, we are committed to continuously \nimproving our ESG Integration approach.Are Japan’s Corporate Governance Reforms Working?\nScott R. Anderson, CFA, Director, Portfolio Manager/Analyst\nJapan, home to some of  the world’s most renowned companies in terms of  operational excellence, has lagged \nits global peers in the areas of  profitability and capital efficiency over the past three decades. This gap, which \ncan be largely explained by the country’s approach to corporate governance, is showing signs of  narrowing. \nWhile there have been setbacks and disappointments in the past, policy reforms ushered in by Prime Minister \nShinzo Abe are driving corporate change, and we are starting to see a difference in our interactions with \nmanagement teams. Better corporate governance has driven improved profitability and, we believe, could lead \nto a rerating of  the Japanese markets.\nWe believe Japanese corporations have made significant strides in corporate governance, but some key issues \nremain. We believe the decline in stable shareholdings is likely to persist and encouraging this trend remains \na focus of  our team’s engagement activities. Japanese boards have become more diverse and independent, \nin line with the government’s policy goals, but independent directors in many cases lack the ability and \nmotivation to provide real oversight to management teams. To empower Japanese boards, we believe more \nsenior business executives need to join the boards of  other companies. A good example is Nidec’s (a Japanese \nmanufacturer of  electric motors) talented CEO Shigenobu Nagamori, who serves on SoftBank’s board (a \nglobal telecommunications and technology investment company). Overall, our discussions with management \nare increasingly two-way, with companies expressing increased interest in our ideas and suggestions. We expect \nthis process to continue.\nRead the entire paper: https://www.lazardassetmanagement.com/us/en_us/research-insights/investment-\nresearch/Are-Japans-Corporate-Governance-Reforms-Working\nHB28537This document reflects the views of Lazard Asset Management LLC or its affiliates (“Lazard”) based upon information believed to be reliable as of the publication date.

ESG Core Principles\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  3The three main areas of focus for responsible investment relate to the environmental and social \nimpact of any business’s activity, and the manner in which a business is managed. Together, these \nfactors are known as Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (‘ESG’).\nESG processes and procedures focus on non-financial performance indicators that address a \ncompany’s approach towards responsible investment, sustainability, its impact on society and the \nenvironment, as well as other ethical and corporate governance considerations.\nEnvironmental  \nThe depletion of natural resources and the threat of climate change have raised concerns about the \nenvironment and the potential financial impact on businesses. Sustainable options are increasingly \nbeing considered as part of investment choices. The issues are diverse but the main areas are:\n—  Factors contributing to climate change\n—  Efficient energy consumption\n—  Responsible disposal of hazardous waste\n—  Sustainability of resources\n—  The impact of climate change on businesses\nSocial\nInclusion, diversity and equality are becoming more important considerations in relation to the way  \nin which businesses operate and can generate competitive advantage; with these areas attracting \nincreasing scrutiny from a range of stakeholders. In particular, there are increasing commercial \nbenefits for businesses which have inclusive and diverse work ethics and practices; and we look  \nat the impact a company has on its employees, local communities and society. The main areas of \nconsideration are:\n—  Preservation of human rights, and avoidance of any complicity in human rights abuses\n—  Equality and diversity amongst employees\n—  Non-discriminatory employment practices\n—  Ensuring there is no exploitation of child labour or indentured servitude\n—  Health and safety\n—  Animal welfare\n—  Corporate donations\nCorporate Governance\nCorporate governance covers the rights and responsibilities of the management of a company –  \nits structures, corporate values and accountability processes. This relates to the following areas:\n—  Management structure – power balance between the CEO and Board, separation of Chairman \nfrom CEO, appropriate checks and balances for members of the management team\n—  Employee relations and workplace grievances\n—  Executive remuneration\n—  Corporate Codes of Conduct\nAs part of Cinven’s response to the challenges of monitoring and reporting on ESG more broadly, we became a signatory to the Principles of Responsible Investment (‘PRI’) in March 2009.ESG Definitions\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  4Cinven’s Core ESG Principles\nCinven’s Core ESG Principles are set out below and are regularly reviewed. Cinven seeks to:\n—  Always comply with both the letter and the spirit of the law, wherever it applies\n—  Ensure that it takes a responsible approach to investing throughout its investment cycle and \nrecognises the potential impact of businesses on the environment, workers, communities and \nsociety, as well as the potential impact of climate change on the businesses in which Cinven invests\n—  Ensure that we and our portfolio companies always respect human rights and ensure no exploitation \nof child labour\n—  Ensure there is no bribery or corruption in any of our dealings\n—  Act with integrity at all times in all our dealings\n—  Always be non-discriminatory (whether on grounds of gender, race or disability), and adopt equality \nand diversity in our employment practices\n—  Act responsibly with respect to the environment, aiming for a sustainable approach to the use of \nresources, avoiding irresponsible disposal of hazardous products and unnecessary waste \n—  Ensure that our management structures and policies reflect the need for transparency, accountability, equality and probity in the management of our businesses\n—  Comply with and inform industry standard ESG guidelines and best practices, and actively manage \nESG considerations and risks effectively.\nIn addition to these Core Principles, Cinven has agreed to the six Principles of Responsible Investment, as set out, by the PRI which are to:\n—  Incorporate ESG issues into our investment analysis and decision making processes\n—  Be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices\n—  Seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest\n—  Promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry\n—  Work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles\n—  Report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.\nWe have incorporated these Principles into our business processes and practices.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  5Pre-Investment Due Diligence\nBefore acquiring a business, Cinven’s Investment team identifies whether there are any ESG-\nrelated key risks or opportunities. Cinven may also use specialist external consultants to help \nassess specific risks. Cinven’s ESG considerations may be company-specific or common to the industry/subsector or geography as a whole, and include political and regulatory \ndevelopments. The considerations are researched through a variety of sources, including \nregulatory/compliance filings, investor disclosures and/or media reports. With support from legal advisors, Cinven also assesses anti-bribery and corruption (‘ABC’) risk and seeks \nassurance that the company is fully compliant with the ESG laws and regulations in the  \nrelevant jurisdictions, for example health and safety, labour and energy usage. This initial ESG \nassessment is an integral part of Cinven’s due diligence and overall risk and value creation \nassessment of the business. \nIf material ESG issues or risks are identified during the due diligence process, Cinven initially \nprioritises those which are most material. Cinven determines on a case-by-case basis whether \nfurther assessment is required, and may seek independent analysis and expert advice from specialist external consultants, for instance environmental experts, if required.\nESG considerations are included in Investment papers, which are presented to, and considered \nby, the Investment Committee. The Investment Committee must give its approval before any \ninvestment is recommended to the Managing General Partner for its consideration.\nCinven subsequently considers whether it deems the risk(s) unacceptable, and thus rejects  \nthe investment opportunity on those grounds, or determines that any risk(s) identified need to \nbe addressed, managed or rectified during its ownership. In cases where material ESG risks are identified and deemed acceptable, a plan is developed by Cinven and agreed with \nmanagement to prioritise, address, manage and/or remedy the issues. This plan is often \nincorporated into the broader Value Creation Plan that is developed with the management team post-investment. In some instances, further obligations or warranties from the vendor may be \nsought, for instance in the purchase documents or as on-going obligations.ESG Procedures\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  6Individual \nMatthew Sabben-Clare  \n \n \nAlex Hess  \n Sarah Verity-Thomas  \nDavid Barker  \nThilo Sautter  \n \nPete Blakeney\nVanessa MaydonLaura ChattingtonBabett Carrier  \n \nPeter Moore  \n Responsibility \nChairman  \n \n \nLP co-ordination / reporting  \n LP co-ordination / reporting  \nPortfolio Review Committee  \nPortfolio team  \n \nPortfolio team\nESG monitoring and reportingESG monitoring and reportingGovernance, regulatory \nsystems, controls and \ncompliance\nGovernance, regulatory \nsystems, controls and compliance \nChief Administrative Officer, \nPartner, Portfolio Review \nCommittee and Operating \nCommittee member\nPartner, Head of Investor \nRelations and Executive \nCommittee member\nManaging Director,  \nInvestor RelationsPartner, Investment and \nExecutive Committee member\nPartner, Head of Portfolio \nteam, Portfolio Review Committee member\nExecutive, Portfolio team\nCorporate Affairs DirectorESG and Marketing ManagerHead of Legal and \nCompliance  \nCompliance Manager  \n ESG Steering Group\nWe have established a firm-wide ESG Steering Group to oversee our reporting requirements and initiatives with the following responsibilities:ESG Procedures continued\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  7ESG Procedures continued\nPost-acquisition implementation process\n Once a company is acquired, Cinven has a standardised approach to engage proactively  \non ESG matters. Cinven puts considerable emphasis on the early integration of ESG \nmanagement in the post-investment phase to ensure that material ESG matters are properly prioritised in the Value Creation Plan, where appropriate, and in performance management \nsystems. \nFrom a corporate governance perspective, Cinven seeks to ensure that its portfolio companies’ \nBoards take responsibility and accountability for all ESG-related topics. At the outset, Cinven \nrepresentatives are appointed to the portfolio company Board. Cinven’s Board representative(s) take responsibility for ensuring that: each Executive Board member is mindful of Cinven’s \napproach towards ESG; the Board has adopted suitable ESG policies; the portfolio company \nregularly reports to the Board on how policies are being implemented and progress towards any targets (including ESG KPI progress); and there are clear responsibilities allocated to Executive \nBoard members for compliance. A Board representative from the portfolio company is assigned \noverall responsibility for ESG, and an agreement is made that ESG will be regularly tabled and reviewed at Board meetings. \n Cinven’s portfolio companies are required to participate in a post-acquisition ESG review and \nmonitoring process. This includes the completion of a Cinven ESG portfolio questionnaire in \norder for Cinven to confirm or identify the main ESG risks and opportunities. The completed \nquestionnaires are reviewed by Cinven, with support from its external advisors. The post-acquisition review process includes evaluation of the resources allocated to ESG at each \nportfolio company. Through early engagement, Cinven identifies and discusses ESG matters \nwith the most appropriate employees, helping them to develop tools and approaches to manage ESG. In several cases, Cinven has recommended that portfolio companies establish their own \nESG Steering Groups that comprise the relevant team members across the organisation \nresponsible for monitoring and reporting on various aspects of ESG (e.g. Legal, HR, Quality Control, Health & Safety). Cinven seeks to identify where it (or an external ESG advisor) is able \nto add value efficiently and effectively. Where an ESG factor is a material consideration, it is \nincorporated into the broader Value Creation Plan. Some investments also have separate ESG work plans that are focused on one particular ESG area. \nCinven completes a full assessment of the portfolio company’s existing policies, practices and \nreporting and how effectively they are communicated and implemented. As part of this review \nprocess, the Cinven team, along with its external ESG advisor(s), works in close collaboration \nwith the portfolio company ESG representatives and management through a series of calls and meetings to discuss and agree priority next steps. \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  8ESG Procedures continued\nPost-acquisition implementation process continued\nAll portfolio companies report against five core KPIs and additional ones are devised as \nnecessary to reflect material company-specific considerations. Cinven works with the portfolio \ncompany management (and in some cases, external ESG advisors) to create bespoke, company-specific ESG KPIs to be tracked and monitored under its ownership. ESG KPI data  \nis captured and reviewed quarterly by the Investment teams, the ESG Steering Group and by external advisors. If the KPIs contain anomalies or discrepancies, they are interrogated further and action taken, if required.\nPortfolio companies are asked to follow Cinven’s ESG guidelines, which include developing an \nESG policy and reporting framework and are designed to provide useful information to portfolio \ncompanies (including resources on best practice reporting and implementation). These seek to \nensure compliance with both Cinven’s requirements, and those created by new regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), the EU Non-Financial Reporting \nDirective, and the UK gender pay gap reporting. Where existing ESG policies and reporting \nframeworks are already in place, the companies are asked to review them in light of Cinven’s guidelines and make improvements or adapt them as necessary.\nPost-acquisition monitoring\n Following the implementation phase of Cinven’s ESG procedures and protocols, as part  \nof Cinven’s active ownership approach, Cinven maintains regular dialogue with its portfolio \ncompanies, through formal Board meetings, ad hoc meetings and calls between Cinven  \nand the relevant ESG representatives, as well as events organised by Cinven, e.g. Cinven’s \nAnnual Portfolio ESG Conference. In addition, the quarterly ESG KPIs reported by the portfolio \ncompanies through Cinven’s central iLevel reporting tool are regularly reviewed and discussed with management.\nAll portfolio companies are regularly reviewed by Cinven’s Investment teams to monitor the ESG \nissues identified during the due diligence or post-acquisition process. This includes monitoring \nthe delivery and outcomes of action plans that have been agreed. It is a requirement for the \nInvestment team to incorporate an update on ESG progress and developments in the quarterly Portfolio Review Committee (‘PRC’) papers, focusing on any material items arising, together \nwith the quarterly ESG KPIs, which are reviewed by Cinven’s Portfolio Review Committee and \nESG Steering Group. \n If new or additional ESG matters arise during Cinven’s ownership of a portfolio company, \nCinven’s approach mirrors that of its pre-acquisition approach. Cinven seeks to assess and rectify the situation through discussion with management and the development of an action \nplan. If a serious ESG risk is identified, the issue is escalated immediately to Cinven’s Portfolio \nReview Committee, ESG Steering Group and, depending on the gravity of the issue, to its Executive Committee.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Policy  9ESG Procedures continued\nPost-acquisition monitoring continued\nMonitoring of portfolio company ESG performance is integrated within Cinven’s broader \nportfolio monitoring processes. Cinven requires that each company’s finance and / or  \nESG team reports the company’s bespoke ESG KPIs alongside its financial and operating \nperformance on a quarterly basis. This information is uploaded into the central iLevel reporting \nsystem and reviewed by the Investment team, the Portfolio team, the Portfolio Review \nCommittee, the ESG Steering Group and external advisor(s). As such, Cinven Investment teams regularly receive ESG performance information and consider it in conjunction with the financial \nperformance of the respective investment. \n If a serious ESG risk is identified during Cinven’s ownership, the issue is escalated immediately \nto the Portfolio Review Committee and, depending on the gravity of the issue, to the Executive \nCommittee. Cinven reports ESG issues in a number of ways including regularly updating  \nits Advisory Committee on any material developments or issues on a bi-annual basis. These \nupdates were originally offered as an optional separate ESG breakout session but in March \n2018, ESG was incorporated into the main agenda of the Advisory Committee meeting.  \nIn addition, in the event of a relevant or sufficiently material ESG matter arising at a portfolio \ncompany, this would be reported in the quarterly Fund Reviews, provided the information is  \nnot commercially sensitive.\nFurther information regarding Cinven’s ESG approach can also be \nfound in its latest ESG Review available on the Responsible investment \nsection of the Cinven website:  \nwww.cinven.com/why/responsible-investment/\nAlternatively, please contact Vanessa Maydon, Corporate Affairs \nDirector, on: vanessa.maydon@cinven.com +44 (0)20 7616 3325.","index":15},{"0":"exponent","1":"https://www.exponentpe.com/sites/default/files/2020-01/Exponent%20ESG%20Report%202018.pdf","2":"1\n1\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20182.

We have made considerable progress since \nimplementing our first Policy on Responsible \nInvestment in 2010, but it is vital that we continue \nto evolve in this area. As a private equity firm, we can \nand should play an important role in driving the sustainability agenda. \nWe are committed to full and transparent reporting \nto investors on all portfolio matters, including ESG. This first ESG Annual Report will support this aim and \nprovide investors with a clear understanding of our \nand our portfolio companies’ ESG activities and risks.\nWe have shared with many of you some of our ESG \nsuccess stories to date, such as the ESG transformation \nat Quorn under our ownership, and we hope that this \nannual report will act as a catalyst for communicating \nfurther such achievements in the coming years. Our \ngoal is to be able to report multiple ESG success stories in each fund that we manage. \nThis report summarises some of the key enhancements \nthat we have made to our Policy on Responsible Investment over the last 12 months and includes \nseveral compelling ESG case studies from our \nportfolio. We have also included a short section \non how we manage ESG at the firm. To support our growing ambition in this area, we \nhave also increased our internal ESG resource, with \nLizzie Stazicker taking day-to-day responsibility for \nmanaging our ESG activities.

This same belief informs our approach to responsible investing. At Exponent, ESG issues are considered at every stage in the deal cycle.\n6 Exponent ESG Annual Report 2018\n7\n7\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20182. Policy, People and ProcessSetting the right ESG policy\nWe are continuously developing our approach to \nresponsible investment (RI) – considering ESG factors \nin investment decisions, in the transformation of our \ncompanies and across all aspects of our business. \nOur Policy on Responsible Investment ensures the \nconsistent implementation of ESG factors across \nall business activities. Created in 2010, the Policy \nis reviewed regularly and was last updated in December 2018. The latest version reflects our enhanced RI processes and procedures and our \ncommitment to the UNPRI and its six principles. \nThe Principles are a voluntary and aspirational set \nof investment principles that aim to incorporate \nESG considerations into the investment process. \nIn line with the Principles, we pledge to:\n• Incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes\n• Be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into Exponent’s ownership policies and practices\n• Seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which Exponent invests\n• Promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry\n• Work together to enhance Exponent’s effectiveness in implementing the Principles\n• Report on Exponent’s activities and progress towards implementing the Principles\nAny amendments to the Policy are reviewed and approved by Exponent’s Governing Body. The Governing \nBody consists of the ten Partners who own the firm and \noversee all operational matters.\nAll members of staff are provided with a copy of the \nPolicy and are required to ensure that the processes \nand procedures are implemented both before and after \nthe acquisition of portfolio companies. \nLooking ahead\nWe review and update our Policy on Responsible Investment every year. In 2019, we will ask employees \nto commit to ESG as part of the Annual Declaration \nthat is signed by each member of staff.\n\n8\n8\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20182. Policy, People and ProcessCraig Vickery, who joined the \nfirm in early 2005, is Exponent’s \nChief Operating Officer and \na Partner and member of our \nGoverning Body.As Exponent’s Managing Partner, Richard Lenane is \nresponsible for all governance matters, including the implementation and monitoring of the firm’s Policy on Responsible Investment. \nTo ensure that the firm’s ESG activities are developed and monitored \nappropriately, Richard has delegated day-to-day ESG oversight and \nmanagement to Craig Vickery and Lizzie Stazicker respectively.\nChief Operating Officer Craig Vickery was instrumental in the \ndevelopment of our first Policy on Responsible Investment in 2010. \nHe has previous experience of leading our ESG activities and for \nmonitoring compliance with the Policy.\nIn her new role as Operations Manager, Lizzie Stazicker will develop \nour approach to ESG to be in line with industry best practice. Lizzie \nis also responsible for day-to-day monitoring and reporting on our \nadherence with our Policy on Responsible Investment. Lizzie is a \nmember of Invest Europe’s Responsible Investment Roundtable \nAffiliate Network.\nHowever, responsibility for ESG topics goes beyond these roles. \nAll Exponent’s Partners are committed to driving and supporting \nour RI and ESG activities and ESG is a recurring item on the agenda \nat the quarterly Partners’ meetings. \nUse of external consultants\nTo supplement Exponent’s in-house skills and resource, we work with external advisors who provide specialist pre-deal ESG due \ndiligence and independent post-deal ESG policy implementation \nand monitoring. For example, PwC’s Sustainability and Climate \nChange team has produced 19 reports for us since 2012. We also \nreceive guidance from SLR Consulting on specific ESG matters.Exponent people driving change\nLizzie Stazicker, who has been with Exponent since early \n2008, was promoted to the \nposition of Operations \nManager at the end of 2017. \nLooking ahead\nWe are committed to dedicating the right level of resource to support our ESG ambitions.

Policy, People and ProcessWe seek to continually improve our ESG processes \nand procedures to drive the implementation of our \nPolicy at Exponent and our portfolio companies. \nTo promote the meaningful adoption of RI principles, \nwe target the following core activities:\n• Investment analysis and decision-making.\n• Ownership policies and practices.\n• Disclosure on ESG issues by portfolio companies. \n• Disclosure on ESG issues to investors.\nIn the last 12 months we have implemented new processes to increase the discussion and reporting \nof ESG topics by Exponent and our portfolio \ncompanies and some of these are covered below.\nTracking ESG KPIs and frequency of \nBoard discussions\nThe introduction of ESG KPI monitoring in 2018 was \ndesigned to reinforce our ESG objectives at the \nportfolio company level. We are committed to \nmaking credible and tangible ESG improvements \nat each portfolio company and want to make ESG \na core tenet of each company’s culture.Our process for ESG performance\nEach portfolio company is now required to select a set of ESG-focused KPIs that are specific to their \nbusiness and monitor them on a quarterly basis. \nThis action encourages each company to consider \nESG on a more frequent and formal basis.\nEach company must also monitor and report on \ncompliance with UK ESG-related laws, including: the \nBribery Act 2010; the Modern Slavery Act 2015; the \nCorporate Criminal Offence legislation; and the GDPR \nand Data Protection Act 2018. This list of ESG-related laws is reviewed and updated on a regular basis.\nAt the end of 2018, 13 out of 16 Exponent portfolio \ncompanies had begun ESG KPI monitoring. Those that \nhad not included Dennis Publishing which was acquired \nin late 2018 and HSS Hire which already has a \nwell-established corporate responsibility programme. \nESG must also be included on the board agenda at \neach portfolio company on a quarterly basis rather than \nannually as previously required. \n\n10\n10\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20182.

Policy, People and ProcessOur process for ESG performance Continued\nCEO and CFO annual budget review\nSenior management involvement is critical in making \nESG core to a company’s operations. CEO and CFOs at \nportfolio companies must now include ESG progress as \npart of their annual budget review with the Exponent \nPartners. This supports the new quarterly ESG KPI \nreporting and encourages senior management to take \nownership of the ESG agenda. To date there has been \nstrong adoption of these new processes and any key \nfindings will be included in future ESG Annual Reports.\nESG events\nWe arrange ESG-related events to promote ESG \ndevelopment and support portfolio companies. \nThese events also promote cross-business \ncollaboration and support.\nIn 2018, we arranged a session on managing cyber \nsecurity risk, which was attended by senior technical \nmanagers from each company. The session was led \nby the chief information security officer at PhotoBox \nand a Slack channel encouraged cross-business \ncollaboration in this area following the event. We \nalso ran events focused on the Corporate Criminal \nOffence legislation and GDPR.\nOur annual Leadership Conference brings together \nover 70 senior executives from across our portfolio. \nThe conference encourages networking and provides \nan opportunity to hear from external speakers on a range of subjects. Many ESG subjects have been \nfeatured strongly in recent years with sessions \ncovering: diversity; ESG and its impact on business; \nand health and wellbeing.\nLooking ahead\nWe are committed to developing our ESG processes and procedures to drive the adoption of responsible \ninvestment principles at Exponent and across all portfolio companies. In 2019 we will enhance ESG \nreporting on our website; provide formal ESG training for the team; and create an ESG roadmap for new \nportfolio companies. \n\nResponsible Investment in Action\n12 Exponent ESG Annual Report 2018All of our portfolio companies are at different points on their ESG journey. \nThey have different issues to tackle and opportunities to realise. Our approach is to use our processes and procedures throughout the deal cycle to identify risks and opportunities and support each company to improve their impact. The following case studies from our portfolio give some examples of how our ESG processes work as we transform portfolio companies.\n13\n13\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20183.  Responsible Investment in ActionKey facts\nCompany: Meadow Foods\nDescription: Leading B2B dairy \ningredients supplier\nHeadquarters: ChesterEmployees: c.300Acquired: August 2018Sector: ConsumerManaging ESG Through Due Diligence\nIt is the deal team’s responsibility to consider ESG during \nthe investment process and bring ESG opportunities and issues to the attention of the Investment Committee.\nIn August 2018, Exponent completed the purchase of Meadow Foods, \na leading B2B dairy ingredients business. During due diligence the \ndeal team identified, amongst other investment risks, potential \nenvironmental issues related to the risk of land contamination \nfrom both effluent and the dairy products themselves. \nIn response the deal team conducted diligence to: better understand \nthe issue and its potential environmental impact; and assess any systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of land contamination. \nDetailed understanding of ESG risks\nEnvironmental diligence had been undertaken in relation to a previous transaction in 2016, and many of the recommendations \nhad been implemented. Nevertheless, the deal team engaged \nenvironmental consultants, SLR Consulting, to perform a further \ndetailed review of environmental compliance at the company’s \nsites, including visits to the Peterborough and Yorkshire facilities.\nDiligence showed that Meadow Foods was using external frameworks \nto help manage ESG risks. The Chester site’s environmental \nmanagement system had been accredited with ISO 14001, with the \ntwo other sites working towards the same accreditation, and the \noccupational health and safety management systems at all three \nsites were accredited with OHSAS 18001. Meadow Foods was also \na member of the global Dairy Sustainability Framework to support compliance with the stringent supply chain requirements of large \nindustry-leading corporate buyers such as Nestle and Unilever.\nDespite these frameworks, diligence identified a few limited \nincidents of discharges (e.g. fat and milk) that exceeded environmental \nstandards; however, the review showed that capex had already \nbeen committed to rectify this matter during 2019.\nConclusions of the deal team and Investment Committee\nBased on the environmental diligence undertaken, the deal team and Investment Committee concluded that Meadow Foods had \na strong culture of environmental compliance. In particular, the \nsenior management team was engaged on the matter, the business \nhad recruited a dedicated environmental manager and there \nwere clear and regular processes in place to monitor \nenvironmental compliance.\n14\n14\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20183.

During diligence, the deal team identified \nthat SHL’s products and services could be used in a positive way to \nmanage unconscious bias and help businesses promote diversity \nand inclusion. Prior to acquisition SHL had shown market \nleadership in this area as one of the primary authors of the \nInternational Test Commission’s “International Guidelines on \nComputer-Based and Internet-Delivered Testing” and had helped \ndefine guidelines for best practice in Unproctored Internet Testing. By identifying this opportunity early we could build on this strong \nposition from the start.Identifying ESG Opportunities at SHL\n\n15\n15\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20183.

Opportunities are often identified during diligence and are then pursued post-acquisition as part of the “100-day” plan and beyond.\nExponent purchased Evergreen Garden Care in late 2017 and \nour early due diligence highlighted a number of environmental risks and opportunities at the business. As a result, SLR Consulting \nwas engaged to assist with the initial environmental review and \npost-acquisition plan. Following a successful tenure as CFO \nat Quorn – an Exponent ESG success story – the deal team also \nappointed Martin Lofnes as incoming CFO with responsibility \nfor ESG oversight.\nPost-acquisition Evergreen Garden Care has, with Exponent’s \nsupport and encouragement, made strong progress against the \ninitial ESG plans set during diligence. They have increased focus \non corporate responsibility, which is now a key component of \ntheir business strategy. For example, the percentage of “natural \nalternatives” to synthetic products available to customers has \nincreased by 10%. \nThe company also made great strides in 2018 as it reduced \nplastic usage by 420 tonnes, increased the use of recycled \nmaterials in packaging by 30% and saved 2,300 tonnes of CO\n2.Managing ESG at Evergreen Garden Care\n\n16\n16\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20183.

We are continuously strengthening these ESG processes to help portfolio companies realise the benefits of strong ESG management and identify opportunities to improve.\nOur new ESG KPI tracking process has enabled Loch Lomond to \nfind savings from ESG data monitoring. Tracking the KPIs showed \nthat the Glen Scotia distillery was reliant on heavy fuel oil and \nwould benefit from switching to a greener fuel source to reduce \ncarbon emissions.\nLoch Lomond identified liquid petroleum gas (LPG) as an alternative \nfuel source, which would enable the company to reduce energy \nconsumption, energy costs and their overall environmental impact. \nIn addition, when sourcing the alternative fuel, Loch Lomond selected a supplier that already delivered to a local dairy, which \nfurther reduces emissions caused through transportation. \nIn their annual budget review, Loch Lomond’s CFO, who is \nresponsible for ESG oversight at the company, noted that while the \nfuel conversion cost £180k it will save approximately £60k each \nyear in energy costs and, importantly, is forecast to reduce carbon \nemissions by 23%.ESG KPI Tracking Uncovers Savings\n\n17\n17\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20183.

In these cases, we try to encourage and promote these activities. \nThis was the case when we purchased Dennis Publishing from \nthe estate of Felix Dennis with all proceeds going to The Heart \nof England Forest charity. Felix Dennis’ passion for philanthropy \nremains embedded within the culture of the business and it \ncontinues to inspire those who work for the company to contribute \nto charitable causes. \nThe business continues to support The Heart of England Forest \ncharity, which was founded by Felix Dennis, and all new joiners to \nthe business are invited to a volunteer day at the forest where they \ncan plant a tree in their name.

Responsible Investment in ActionKey facts\nCompany: Pattonair\nDescription: Aerospace and \ndefence supply chain management services\nHeadquarters: DerbyEmployees: c.950\nAcquired: June 2011\nSector: Support servicesWe take great pride in supporting our portfolio companies \nto make credible and meaningful ESG improvements which survive beyond the ownership period. As the previous examples show this is a long-term transformation beginning pre-acquisition and continuing beyond Exponent’s involvement. \nWhen we acquired Pattonair in 2011 the company did not have a \nclear ESG strategy or policy, despite supplying some of the world’s \nlargest engine manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce. \nWe engaged PwC’s Sustainability and Climate Change team \npost-acquisition to complete an initial ESG review. The review \nhighlighted several ESG opportunities and enabled the Exponent \ndeal team to raise the importance of ESG within the business and \nensure that it was given appropriate consideration at the board-level.\nOver the period of ownership, the deal team implemented Exponent’s \nESG policies and procedures, which led to improvements in \ncustomer service standards, environmental management and \nsupplier relationships. At the same time customer tender bids were \nincreasingly including ESG criteria and so the improvements \nsupported the business’ continued commercial success. Inspired by the improvements it had made, the company published its first \nreport on corporate social responsibility in 2016.\nThe cultural embedding of ESG at Pattonair led to many improvements \nthat reduced energy and material usage, managed waste and \nminimised carbon emissions. Initiatives included: reducing the use \nof plastic when supplying parts to customers; replacing vehicles \nwith more efficient models, using electric where possible; and \noverhauling the lighting system to use more energy-efficient LED lights.\nIn line with Exponent’s Policy, PwC was re-engaged in 2016 to \nre-review ESG at Pattonair and comment upon any improvements \nmade. PwC noted: “Pattonair has made significant progress to improve \nits management of ESG issues, from satisfactory to good practice.”\nIn October 2017, Exponent sold its interest in Pattonair to Platinum \nEquity. During the sale process the management presentation \nincluded a section on management’s priorities for environmental and social initiatives and each prospective purchaser had access \nto the company’s CSR report. This was a clear step up from the \nprocess in 2011 and was a demonstration of the credible and tangible \nESG improvements made over the period of ownership by Exponent.Pattonair: an ESG Success Story\n\n19 Exponent ESG Annual Report 2018How we Manage ESG at the Firm4\nIn addition to promoting ESG good practice across the portfolio, \nwe are also committed to making a difference by reducing the impact of our operations and supporting our people to succeed. \n20\n20\nExponent ESG Annual Report 20184.

We believe sustainability must be at the heart of a prosperous society, which is why we aim to support sustainable development that generates wealth, protects our natural environment and enhances the health, wellbeing and dignity of people in our markets. \nWith just 10 years to achieve the UN \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the global community – governments, companies and multi-lateral organisations – must act individually and collectively to create innovative solutions that deliver sustainable prosperity. The transformation of our sustainability performance, which began in 2018, continued at pace in 2019. In a year of exciting ‘frsts’, I am pleased to be able to share our progress with you in this report. \nWe developed innovative sustainable \nfnancing solutions, took bold steps to address major challenges such as inequality and climate change, and set ambitious new targets through refreshed Sustainability Aspirations. \nThe launch of our inaugural Sustainability \nBond and the world’s frst Sustainability Deposit to support the SDGs in emerging markets marked sustainable fnance milestones for our business. Our new, combined $75 billion target for sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy will support clients’ transition to a low-carbon future. Recognising the rising global urgency around climate change, we accelerated our emissions work and took further steps to reduce our fnancing of coal. We have made good progress, but are not complacent; we know there is more to be done. \nAcross our operations, we are challenging \nourselves to go further to reduce our environmental impact. I am proud of the decision we made in 2019 to target ‘net zero’ emissions from our operations by 2030. We are already mobilising our employees and operations to turn this ambition into reality. \nWe continue to fght fnancial crime and build \na culture that emphasises sustainability and conduct through our refreshed Sustainability Aspirations. We believe in providing a diverse and inclusive workplace for employees. In 2019, we signed the International Labour Organisation Global Business Disability Network Charter to further reinforce our commitment to be a disability confdent organisation, focusing on removing barriers and increasing accessibility for employees. \nWe are also removing the barriers to \nopportunity that face young people in our communities through Futuremakers by Standard Chartered, our global initiative to tackle inequality. In 2019, we contributed $9.4 million through fundraising and Group donations toward our target of $50 million between 2019 and 2023. \nI am looking forward to our frst Futuremakers \nForum in the second half of 2020 where we will bring programme participants, clients and development experts together to build a shared vision of sustainable prosperity for young people in our markets. Our employees also play an important role supporting Futuremakers and other community projects through volunteering.

Measurement metrics provided are in line with the global Impact Reporting and Investment Standards. \nPrivate Bank has also incorporated \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG) scores into its wealth management investment advisory trade notes for equities, allowing clients to build ESG considerations into their equity investment. \n07 06 \nOVERVIEW Responsible Company Sustainability data Inclusive Communities Sustainable Finance\nStandard Chartered  \nSustainability Summary 201908 09 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n     \n  \n  \n     \n \n \n  \n   \n    Our approach to sustainability \nSustainable \nFinance \nHere \nfor good Our approach \nOur purpose is to drive commerce and \nprosperity through our unique diversity. Our sustainability vision is to become the most sustainable and responsible bank, and the leading private sector catalyser of fnance for the SDGs where it matters most, across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. \nWe embed sustainability across our \nbusiness, operations and communities through our sustainability framework. By focusing on three sustainability pillars – Sustainable Finance, Responsible Company and Inclusive Communities – we believe we can deliver sustainable prosperity in line with our valued behaviours and our promise to be Here for good. \nThis approach is framed around a \nSustainability Philosophy that informs our \nRESPONSIBLE COMPANY Responsible \nCompany Inclusive \nCommunities decision-making, Position Statements that set out our environmental and social client standards, and a list of Prohibited Activities (sc.com/prohibitedactivities) that sets out the activities that the Bank will not fnance. \nIt is underpinned by our Sustainability \nAspirations, which provide tangible targets for sustainable business outcomes aligned to the SDGs. Details of our progress is on the following pages and our refreshed Aspirations for 2020 onwards are at the back of this report. \nIn 2018, we laid the foundations for an \nambitious transformation of our sustainability performance and in 2019, we built on this with positive results. We created sustainable fnance products and a governance framework that support our commitment to contribute to meeting the SDGs in emerging markets. \nEstimated number of \nelephants poached each year (WWF) \n20,000 Tackling the illegal wildlife trade \nas a fnancial crime \nThe illicit poaching of wildlife is driving many species to the edge of extinction. The World \nWildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that on average more than 20,000 African elephants and more than 1,000 rhinos are killed each year. But the illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is not just a conservation issue. A report by the United Nations Environmental Programme estimates that it is worth between $7 billion and $23 billion annually, making it the fourth most signifcant traffcking crime behind arms, human and narcotics traffcking. \nMany countries within our unique footprint are vulnerable to IWT either as source, transit or \ndestination markets. This puts us on the frontline of the challenge to do our part to disrupt and prevent this illicit activity. We have included IWT-specifc content in the anti-money laundering training completed by all employees and delivered targeted awareness sessions in key markets. We have also made IWT a focus for our fnancial crime investigators, enabling those efforts through new artifcial intelligence and machine-learning tools. \nWe believe that partnering to lead in the fght against fnancial crime is the best way to \nprotect our business, clients and communities. That’s because we recognise that no single company, law enforcement or sovereign acting alone can eradicate fnancial crime. We will only succeed if we collaborate with each other. \nAs a member of The Royal Foundation’s United for Wildlife (UfW) IWT Financial Taskforce, \nwe are working with other fnancial institutions around the world, as well as government bodies and NGOs, to raise awareness of the importance of tackling IWT as a fnancial crime and to build IWT into members’ business-as-usual compliance operations. We are sharing what we have learned with our clients by integrating IWT into our correspondent banking academies in countries such as Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa and Vietnam in 2019. We also contributed to the delivery of UfW training workshops on IWT during 2019, including workshops in Beijing, Hong Kong and Nairobi. We accelerated our response to climate change, publishing our emissions white paper to encourage collaboration across the fnance sector, updating our position on coal and integrating climate into our Group’s risk framework. As part of our refreshed Sustainable Aspirations, we set stretching new targets for Sustainable Finance, as well as People, Environment, Conduct and Financial Crime Compliance, and we continued to deliver for our communities through volunteering and community programmes. \nIn 2019, we signed up to the UN Principles \nfor Responsible Banking, supporting our progress and that of the industry as we demonstrate our contribution to achieving society’s goals. As part our commitment, we are embarking on third-party, limited assurance on a selection of our Sustainability Aspirations as they represent our most signifcant impacts. \nGovernance \nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that high standards of responsible business are maintained and receives information to identify and assess signifcant risks and opportunities related to environmental and social matters, including climate change. Sustainability is overseen by the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee of the Board, which reviews sustainability priorities and oversees the development of, and delivery against, public commitments around sustainability. \nAt a management level, the CEO, Corporate \n& Institutional Banking is responsible for Sustainable Finance, which incorporates environmental and social risk management. The Group Head, Corporate Affairs, Brand & Marketing, Conduct, Financial Crime & Compliance leads a cross-business Sustainability Forum to develop and deliver the Group’s broader sustainability strategy and champions sustainability across the Group. Our focus on good governance extends to the development of new sustainable fnance products. In 2019, we developed a Green and Sustainable Product Framework and a Green and Sustainable Bond Framework that set out all eligible and excluded activities and themes for future sustainable products that help fund the SDGs across our footprint markets, especially in developing countries. The frameworks were developed in collaboration with leading environmental, social and governance research provider Sustainalytics and will be subject to internal review annually. \nEngaging stakeholders \nOpen and transparent engagement is an important part of building strong relationships with government, regulators, investors, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society. If we are to deliver sustainable prosperity, we need to understand the long-term challenges facing our markets. \nDuring 2019, we increased our dialogue \nand engagement with stakeholders including civil society, regulators and investors on a range of sustainability themes that matter to them and impact our business, including coal, climate change, sustainable fnance and human rights. The key themes, frst identifed through a limited-scope materiality review in 2017 , continue to represent the main topics raised by stakeholders. In 2019, we started developing a new materiality survey, which will be issued in 2020. \nWe set out how we manage these topics \nthrough policies and statements on sc.com, progress reported in the Group’s Annual Report and this publication. The table below sets out where stakeholders can fnd responses to the top fve topics identifed. \nUnderstanding our sustainability themes \nEnvironmental \nand social issues Responses \nClimate change ¼Position Statements (sc.com/positionstatements) \n¼2019 Climate Change /Taskforce for Climated-related Financial \nDisclosures report (sc.com/tcfd) \n¼Climate Change Aspiration (p11) \n¼Group Chief Risk Offcer’s review (2019 Annual Report & Accounts - p38) \nConduct, values and ethics \n¼Group Code of Conduct (sc.com/codeofconduct) \n¼Conduct Aspiration (p13) \n¼Sustainable and responsible business (2019 Annual Report and Accounts - p54) \nEnvironmental \n¼Environmental and Social Risk Management \nand social risk (sc.com/positionstatements) \nmanagement ¼Our standards and policies (sc.com/sustainability) \nHuman rights ¼2019 Modern Slavery Statement (sc.com/modernslavery) \n¼Position Statements (sc.com/positionstatements) \n¼Sustainable and responsible business (2019 Annual Report and Accounts - p54) \nTalent attraction \n¼People Aspiration (p13) \nand engagement ¼Employees (2019 Annual Report and Accounts - p47) \nSustainability data Inclusive Communities\nStandard Chartered  \nSustainability Summary 201910 11 \nResponsible Company Overview SUSTAINABLE FINANCE\n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n    \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n   \n     \n  \n  \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n Pillar 1: Business \nSustainable Finance \nObjective \nWe use our core business \nto promote sustainable development in our markets, while managing the environmental and social risks associated with our fnancing activities. \nSustainable \nFinance \nOur 2020 Sustainability Aspirations can be \nfound at the back of this document \nFinancing needs for the \nSDGs being met in low and middle-income countries \n60% \nOverview \nOur unique footprint across emerging \nmarkets enables us to focus sustainable fnance where it matters most. We deliver fnance that drives positive social and economic impact and manage environmental and social risks associated with our fnancing activities. \nWe are increasing sustainable fnance to \nsupport the SDGs, including the low-carbon transition. In 2019, we issued our inaugural €500 million Sustainability Bond focused on emerging markets. We also launched the world’s frst Sustainable Deposit in London and Asia’s frst Sustainable Deposit in Singapore. This was followed by launches in Hong Kong and New York. Every dollar deposited will be referenced against sustainable assets. We mobilised $22.3 billion for infrastructure development, supported $20 billion towards clean technology and helped our clients to issue $18.3 billion in green, social and sustainable bonds. We advised 14 sovereigns and two multilateral agencies on credit ratings. \nIn 2019, we refreshed our Sustainability \nAspirations. Between January 2020 and December 2024, we will fund and faciliate \nSUSTAINABLE FINANCE $40 billion for infrastructure that supports sustainable development and $35 billion for renewable energy. We will provide $15 billion to small business clients and $3 billion to microfnance institutions. \nOur main impact on the environment and \nsociety is through the business activities we fnance. We closely manage lending to high-impact sectors and in 2019, reviewed 1,127 transactions against our Position Statements. We also announced we would only support clients who actively transition their business to generate less than 10 per cent of earnings from thermal coal by 2030. \nDuring 2019, we continued to evolve our \nmethodology to measure, manage and ultimately reduce our fnanced emissions, publishing a white paper in May outlining our progress. We have used this to drive conversation and collaboration with industry peers in this area. A new team within Enterprise Risk Management is developing a framework to assess climate risk and build it into our mainstream risk management practices and governance. \nSee sc.com/tcfd for more on cl imate change. 2019 SUSTAINABILITY ASPIRATIONS: SUSTAINABLE FINANCE \nConcluded in the year \nAchieved Not achieved Ongoing aspirations \nOn track Not on track Aspirations Target: We will work with \nour clients to: Target date Progress \nInfrastructure \nEveryone should have access to safe, \nreliable and affordable power and infrastructure which transforms lives and strengthens economies \n¼Provide advisory, fnancing, debt structuring services and policy advice for $25 billion of infrastructure projects, including $4 billion toward clean technology ¼Jan 2017 – Dec 2019 (infrastructure) 2019: $22.3 billion 2017-2019: $55.9 billion \n¼Jan 2016 – Dec 2019 (clean technology) 2019: $20 billion 2016-2019: $24.9 billion \nClimate change \nClimate change is one of today’s greatest challenges and addressing it is essential to promote sustainable economic growth \n¼Develop a methodology to measure, manage and ultimately reduce the emissions related to the fnancing of our clients ¼Jan 2019 – Dec 2020 \nEntrepreneurs \nEntrepreneurs are the heart of local economies, creating jobs and empowering people \n¼Provide $6 billion to Business Banking clients ¼Jan 2017 – Dec 2019 2019: $2.8 billion \n2017-2019: $8.9 billion \n¼Grow our lending to smaller business clients in our Commercial Bank by 20%* ¼Jan 2017 – Dec 2019 2017-2019: 12% \nDigital: \nEveryone should have access to digital banking products enabling safe, effcient and inclusive banking \n¼Continue to provide ‘last mile’ payments and collections to clients in our footprint though our Straight2Bank wallet ¼Jan 2017 – Dec 2019 2019: 53% increase in average \nmobile money transactions to more than 149,700 per month \nCommerce \nTrade creates jobs and contributes to economies by enabling people to connect across borders \n¼Bank 8,000 of our clients’ international and domestic networks of suppliers and buyers through banking the ecosystem programmes ¼Jan 2017 – Dec 2020 2019: 2,907 new clients \n2017-2019: 7,631 new clients \nImpact and \nsustainable fnance \nInnovative fnancial products and \npartnerships can help us solve global development challenges and improve the lives of millions in our markets \n¼Provide $1 billion of fnancing to microfnance institutions to extend access to fnance ¼Jan 2016 – Dec 2020 2019: $710 million \n2016-2019: $2.4 billion \n¼Facilitate opportunities for our Private Bank clients to invest in impact investing funds in our markets ¼Jan 2016 – Dec 2020 2019: 3 funds available \n¼Continue to promote blended fnance capabilities ¼Jan 2016 – Dec 2020 Largest commercial provider of \nBlended Finance in 2019 (Convergence) \n*Growth (%) as measured by customer loans and advances between 2017 and 2019 Delivering fnance where \nit matters most \nThe world is just a decade away from its 2030 deadline to deliver the SDGs. Yet, according \nto a UN report, just 60 per cent of the fnancing needed to achieve the Goals in low and middle-income countries is being met. In Africa, this is as low as 10 per cent. In 2019, we launched the world’s frst Sustainable Deposit where every dollar deposited will be referenced against sustainable assets that support the SDGs. \nCorporate and Institutional clients in London, Singapore, Hong Kong and New York, along \nwith Retail clients in Singapore, can now use their money to help address some of the world’s biggest threats including climate change, fnancial exclusion and lack of access to health and education. \nThe deposit is linked to our new Green and Sustainable Product Framework, which sets \nout qualifying themes and activities aligned to the SDGs. Liquidity raised from the deposit will provide fnancing for microfnance institutions, small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of sustainable infrastructure and services that provide clean energy and improve water, health and education services in middle- and low-income countries. \nThe deposit is just one of the ways we are mobilising private capital to where it matters \nmost. Our aim is to help close the annual $2.5 trillion gap that the UN estimates exists in relation to the SDGs. \nSustainability data Inclusive Communities\nStandard Chartered  \nSustainability Summary 201912 13 \nSustainable Finance Overview RESPONSIBLE COMPANY\n \n  \n \n \n       \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n    \n    \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n   \n  \n \n \n    \n  \n     \n  \n  \n  \n   \n                  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Pillar 2: Operations \nResponsible Company \nObjective \nWe strive to manage our \nbusiness sustainably and responsibly, drawing on our purpose, brand promise, valued behaviours and Code of Conduct to enable us to make the right decisions. \nResponsible \nCompany \nOur 2020 Sustainability Aspirations can be \nfound at the back of this document \nWater blade units installed \n200 \nOverview \nGood governance is a priority for us and our \nstakeholders. Along with our purpose, brand promise and valued behaviours, our Code of Conduct sets out our conduct expectations and supports good decision-making. In 2019, 99.5 per cent of employees recommitted to the Code. During 2019, 1,383 concerns were raised through our confdential and anonymous whistleblowing channel, Speaking Up, of which 528 were in scope of the programme and were investigated or resolved. \nFinancial crime has serious social and \neconomic consequences, which is why we believe partnering to lead in the fght against fnancial crime and making the fnancial system a hostile environment for criminals. All eligible Bank employees complete relevant training for fnancial crime compliance. In 2019, 99.9 per cent of employees completed anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) training, 99.9 per cent completed anti-money \nlaundering (AML) training and 99.9 per cent completed sanctions training. \nWe continue to progress toward an inclusive, \ninnovative performance culture. We are committed to providing employees with \nRESPONSIBLE COMPANY interesting and impactful jobs and opportunities to prepare themselves for the changing world of work. We are on track to have 30 per cent female representation in senior roles by the end of 2020 and have set a new target of 35 per cent by the end of 2024. We achieved our market-leading ambition to assure that we pay all our employed workers a living wage in 2019. This follows an extensive exercise with an NGO partner to understand living wages across our 59 markets. During 2020, we will continue this work, assessing the feasibility of extending the living wage to contractors and third parties. \nWe aim to minimise the environmental impact \nof our operations. We have met our long-term energy and water reduction targets. Between 2008 and 2019, we reduced energy use by 63 per cent and water use by 72 per cent. Our new Aspirations include achieving ‘net zero’ emissions from our operations and sourcing only renewable energy by 2030. \nIn 2020, we will develop a Bank-wide Climate \nAction Plan to ensure that we meet our commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. \nReducing our environmental \nimpact in West Africa \nMany of our markets in West Africa lack reliable and consistent access to clean electricity; \ninstead they must rely on diesel generators. While this can make energy reduction efforts challenging, we are leading the drive for more sustainable standards. In 2019, our property teams in Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Côte d’Ivoire reduced energy use by 30 per cent across the region, cut water use and reduced waste. \nSierra Leone has seen energy use drop by 90 per cent since 2017 by upgrading air \nconditioning units, ftting LED lights and right-sizing generators. The Gambia cut its diesel consumption by replacing generators with inverters and battery storage solutions across its branches. Nigeria installed solar photovoltaic panels across seven locations, avoiding 17 tons of CO\n2 emissions and, together with Ghana, replaced more than 220 air-conditioning \nunits with energy-effcient alternatives. \nTo save water, Nigeria and Ghana installed more than 200 water blade units cutting usage \nby 20 per cent while Côte d’Ivoire tackled the plastics challenge, removing plastic cutlery and installing water dispensers to replace plastic bottles. A new partnership with a local recycling company has already resulted in approximately 114 kilogrammes of plastics recycled in the past eight months. 2019 SUSTAINABILITY ASPIRATIONS: RESPONSIBLE COMPANY \nAspirations Target: We will Target date Progress \nPeople \nOur people are our greatest asset, \nand our diversity drives our business success \n¼Increase gender representation: 30% women in senior roles ¼Sept 2016 – Dec 2020 2019: 28.5% women in senior roles \n¼Defning and implementing a Living Wage for all employed workers ¼Jan 2019 – Dec 2019 \n¼Conduct a feasibility analysis for incorporating a Living Wage into agreements for non-employed workers ¼Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 \nEnvironment \nReducing our own impact on the environment will protect our planet for the beneft of our communities \n¼Reduce annual energy use by 35% to 230 kWh/m\n2/year in our \ntropical climate locations (80% of portfolio) ¼Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 2008-2019: 38% reduction \n¼Reduce annual energy use by 31% to 275 kWh/m\n2/year in our \ntemperate climate locations (20% of portfolio) ¼Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 2008-2019: 44% reduction \n¼Reduce our annual water use by 72% to 0.5kL/m\n2/year ¼Jan 2008 – Dec 2019 2008-2019: 72% reduction \n¼Reduce annual offce paper use by 57% to 10kg/FTE/year ¼Jan 2012 – Dec 2020 2012-2019: 27% reduction \n¼Reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 90% to 18,000 tonnes by 2050* with interim targets: – 2025: 121,000 tonnes – 2030: 84,000 tonnes ¼Jan 2019 - Dec 2050 2019: 22% reduction \nConduct \nGood conduct and high ethical standards are essential in achieving fair outcomes for our clients \n¼Effectively embed conduct risk considerations into the Group’s product governance activities with all businesses expected to implement the revised standards ¼Jan 2019 – Dec 2019 99.5% of employees reconfrmed \ncommitment to the Code of Conduct in September 2019 \nFinancial crime \ncompliance \nFinancial crime has serious social and \neconomic consequences, harming individuals and communities \n¼All eligible Bank staff to complete relevant ABC, AML and sanctions training with less than 2% overdue ¼Ongoing 99.9% of employees completed ABC training \n99.9% of employees \ncompleted AML training \n99.9% of employees \ncompleted sanctions training \n¼Deliver at least 10 correspondent banking academies ¼Jan 2019 – Dec 2019 19 correspondent banking \nacademies delivered \nConcluded in the year \nAchieved Not achieved Ongoing aspirations \nOn track Not on track \n* From a 2017 baseline of 187,936 tonnes. \nResponsible Company Sustainability data Sustainable Finance\nStandard Chartered  \nSustainability Summary 201914 15 \nOVERVIEW INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES\n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n   \n   \n  \n     \n   \n  \n    \n  \n    \n  \n    \n \n    \n                  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Pillar 3: Communities \nInclusive Communities \nObjective \nWe aim to create more \ninclusive economies by sharing our skills and expertise and developing community programmes that transform lives. \nInclusive \nCommunities \nOur 2020 Sustainability Aspirations  can be \nfound  at the back of this document \nGirls reached through Goal \nbetween 2006 and 2019 \n590,300 Overview \nIn 2019, we invested $51.1 million in \ncommunities and employees contributed more than 51,300 volunteering days. \nIn the frst year of Futuremakers by Standard \nChartered, our new global initiative to tackle inequality, we contributed $9.4 million through fundraising and Group donations and delivered projects in 34 markets. Our target is to raise $50 million between 2019 and 2023 through fundraising and Group donations to empower the next generation to learn, earn and grow. \nAs part of Futuremakers, we expanded Goal, \nour existing girls’ empowerment programme, which reached more than 108,400 girls and young women in 2019. We also launched new global programmes in 2019. \nYouth to Work reached 1,834 young people \nthrough employability projects. In addition, we reached 9,269 young people, micro and small businesses through entrepreneurship activities, including our Women in Tech (WiT) incubators. In 2019, we launched WiT in Pakistan, Dubai and Nigeria to support women-led ventures enabled by technology. We are continuing to support the delivery of eye health projects as part of Seeing is Believing (SiB), our global initiative to tackle avoidable blindness. Between 2003 and 2019, we reached 212.7 million people through SiB and raised and matched a total of $104.2 million. We are using our knowledge and experience from SiB to mobilise support for the Vision Catalyst Fund (VCF), which aims to raise $1 billion to fund sustainable eye care projects. We are also supporting people with visual impairments through Futuremakers. \nIn 2020, we will scale-up and roll-out \nFuturemakers programmes, continue to support the creation of the VCF and develop and implement a robust measurement and evaluation framework. We will host our frst Futuremakers Forum bringing together programme participants, clients and development experts. \nThe Standard Chartered Foundation was set \nup in 2019 to advance charitable purposes. It will be the Group’s lead partner in delivering its philanthropic activities, including Futuremakers by Standard Chartered. \nINCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES \nMeasuring the impact of Goal \nWe are committed to supporting girls and young women in our markets to gain the skills they need to become integral leaders in their communities through Goal, our girls’ empowerment programme. Between 2006 and 2019, Goal reached more than 590,300 adolescent girls with its sports-based curriculum, which is designed to build life skills and confdence. \nTo support our ambition to reach one million girls through Goal by 2023, we have brought \nthe programme into Futuremakers by Standard Chartered as its fagship education programme. In 2019, we extended the programme to the UK, Korea, Nepal and Zimbabwe. Through Goal, we can offer girls the opportunity to develop leadership and work-readiness skills. In 2019, 240 girls had paid roles as staff, coaches, facilitators and referees, and 941 girls had unpaid roles as Goal Champions, peer leaders or volunteers. \nDuring the year, we commissioned global development think tank Overseas Development \nInstitute (ODI) to assess Goal’s impact. Using survey data from more than 18,000 girls and interviews and focus groups with 300 girls, parents, teachers, community leaders and boys, ODI found strong evidence of Goal’s positive and lasting impact. \nAfter completing Goal, girls reported a 14 per cent increase in self-confdence, a \n28 per cent increase in knowledge about health and a 18 per cent increase in knowledge about savings and fnance.

We also offer micro-loans and business mentoring so they can set up small-scale businesses. The project is delivered by Standard Chartered employee volunteers who travel to the tea estates to train workers, review business proposals and act as mentors to help ensure the businesses succeed. \nTo date, 129 community members from 11 estates have received fnancial training and \n14 businesses are being supported. By helping tea pluckers to become entrepreneurs, we aim to create more prosperous and inclusive communities where we operate. \nResponsible Company Inclusive Communities Sustainable Finance\nStandard Chartered  \nSustainability Summary 201916 17 \nOverview SUSTAINABILITY DATA \n   \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n    \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n   \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n 2020 Sustainability Aspirations \nOur Sustainability Aspirations build on our three sustainability pillars with measurable targets to show how we are achieving sustainable outcomes \nacross our business.
