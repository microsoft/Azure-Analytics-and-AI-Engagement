        "This notebook shows how to use Fairlearn (an open-source fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation package) and Azure Machine Learning Studio for a binary classification problem. In this notebook, we will be using a loan decision dataset. The label indicates whether or not each individual repaid a loan in the past. We will use the data to train a predictor to predict whether previously unseen individuals will repay a loan or not. The assumption is that the model predictions are used to decide whether an individual should be offered a loan.\n",

        "Farilearn mitigates disparity using two types of algorithms, reduction, and post-processing. We will apply the grid search algorithm, a reduction algorithm, from the Fairlearn package using a specific notion of fairness called Demographic Parity. Reduction algorithms reduce disparity by training models on reweighted datasets. This produces a set of models, and we will view these in a dashboard both locally and in the Azure Machine Learning Studio. We will also see the trade-off between model performance and disparity visually through Fairlearn dashboards, which can help make an informed decision about the model.\n",
