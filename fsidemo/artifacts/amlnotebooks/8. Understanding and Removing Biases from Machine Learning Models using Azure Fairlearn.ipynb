    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use Fairlearn (an open-source fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation package) and Azure Machine Learning Studio for a binary classification problem. In this notebook, we will be using a loan decision dataset. The label indicates whether or not each individual repaid a loan in the past. We will use the data to train a predictor to predict whether previously unseen individuals will repay a loan or not. The assumption is that the model predictions are used to decide whether an individual should be offered a loan.\n",

    "Farilearn mitigates disparity using two types of algorithms, reduction, and post-processing. We will apply the grid search algorithm, a reduction algorithm, from the Fairlearn package using a specific notion of fairness called Demographic Parity. Reduction algorithms reduce disparity by training models on reweighted datasets. This produces a set of models, and we will view these in a dashboard both locally and in the Azure Machine Learning Studio. We will also see the trade-off between model performance and disparity visually through Fairlearn dashboards, which can help make an informed decision about the model.\n",

    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this notebook, an Azure Machine Learning workspace is required. This notebook also requires the following packages:\n",
    "* `azureml-contrib-fairness`\n",
    "* `fairlearn==0.4.6` (v0.5.0 will work with minor modifications)\n",
    "* `joblib`\n",
    "* `liac-arff`\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairlearn relies on features introduced in v0.22.1 of `scikit-learn`. If you have an older version already installed, please uncomment and run the following cell:"

    "In this notebook we have demonstrated how to use the `GridSearch` algorithm from Fairlearn to generate a collection of models, and then present them in the fairness dashboard in Azure Machine Learning Studio. Please remember that this notebook has not attempted to discuss the many considerations which should be part of any approach to unfairness mitigation. The [Fairlearn website](http://fairlearn.org/) provides that discussion"
