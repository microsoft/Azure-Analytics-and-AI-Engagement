> **Note:** Real-time reports will not be deployed as part of the ARM Template deployment. For that we need to create real-time reports [(See Task 6)](#task-6-working-with-power-bi-to-create-real-time-reports).

![Further steps to pin visualization on the dashboard.](media/Dashboard3.png)

### Task 6: Working with Power BI to create real-time reports

'Racing Cars' and 'Milling canning' datasets will be automatically created when Azure Stream Analytics jobs start sending data into Power BI services.
 Once the Dataset has been created in the Power BI workspace, (by Azure Cloud Shell commands executed in [Task 3](#task-3-deploy-the-arm-template) above) follow the next steps to create the Power BI report 'Racing Cars- A'.

1. **Click** on '+Create' button present on the top navigation bar.

2. **Select** 'Report' option from the drop-down menu.

!['Report' option from the drop-down menu.](media/report_option.png)

![Card icon from Visualization tray.](media/card_icon.png)

6. **Select** the 'ActiveSensors' field from 'race-cars' Dataset.

7. **Select** drop-down next to 'ActiveSensors'.

8. **Select** 'Average' from the drop-down to get the average of 'ActiveSensors'.

![Avg of ActiveSensors.](media/avg_active_sensors.png)

9. With Card visual selected, **select** the format tab.

10. **Turn on** the Title.

11. **Enter** 'Active Sensors' as the title for the card.

![Card Visual selected.](media/active_sensors.png)

12. **Turn on** Background and change the background color of the card.

Similarly, the color of the KPI value and title value can be changed from the Data label and Title sections respectively. You can use the Hex code #00222F to achieve the background color of the visual.

![Turn on background.](media/Background-Dark.png)

All other visuals of the report can be created by following a similar process. By following the same process for the 'milling canning' Dataset we can create the following real-time reports
- Milling Canning report
- Maintenance and Cost Analytics
- Miami Racing Cars
 
Once these real-time reports are ready we can pin them to the dashboard (by following the procedure explained in [Task 5](#task-5-power-bi-dashboard-creation)) to finally achieve the following look and feel.
