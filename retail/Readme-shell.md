# Retail2.0 DREAM Demo in a Box Setup Guide

## What is it?
DREAM Demos in a Box (DDiB) are packaged Industry Scenario DREAM Demos with ARM templates (with a demo web app, Power BI reports, Synapse resources, AML Notebooks etc.) that can be deployed in a customer’s subscription using the CAPE tool in a few hours.  Partners can also deploy DREAM Demos in their own subscriptions using DDiB.

 ## Objective & Intent
Partners can deploy DREAM Demos in their own Azure subscriptions and show live demos to customers. 
In partnership with Microsoft sellers, partners can deploy the Industry scenario DREAM demos into customer subscriptions. 
Customers can play,  get hands-on experience navigating through the demo environment in their own subscription and show to their own stakeholders

## Requirements

* An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace.
* A Power BI Pro or Premium account to host Power BI reports.
* Make sure you are the Power BI administrator for your account and service principal access is enabled on your Power BI tenant.
* Make sure the following resource providers are registered with your Azure Subscription.
   - Microsoft.Sql 
   - Microsoft.Synapse 
   - Microsoft.StreamAnalytics 
   - Microsoft.EventHub 
   - Microsoft.Media.MediaServices
* You can run only one deployment at any point in time and need to wait for its completion. You should not run multiple deployments in parallel as that will cause deployment failures.
* Select a region where the desired Azure Services are available. If certain services are not available, deployment may fail. See [Azure Services Global Availability](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=all) for understanding target service availability. (consider the region availability for Synapse workspace, Iot Central and cognitive services while choosing a location)
* Do not use any special characters or uppercase letters in the environment code. Also, do not re-use your environment code.
* In this Accelerator we have converted Real-time reports into static reports for the ease of users but have covered entire process to configure Realtime dataset. Using those Realtime dataset you can create Realtime reports.
* Please ensure that you select the correct resource group name. We have given a sample name which may need to be changed should any resource group with the same name already exist in your subscription.
* The audience for this document is CSAs and GBBs.
* Please log in to Azure and Power BI using the same credentials.
* Once the resources have been setup, please ensure that your AD user and synapse workspace have “Storage Blob Data Owner” role assigned on storage account name starting with “stretail”. You need to contact AD admin to get this done.
* Please review the [License Agreement](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/blob/main/CDP-Retail/license.md) before proceeding.

18. **Close** the browser tab once you see the message window at right, and then go back to your Azure Cloud Shell execution window.

	![Close the browser tab.](media/cloud-shell-13.png)

19. Now you will be prompted to select subscription if you have multiple subscription assigned to the user you used for device login.

    ![Close the browser tab.](media/select-sub.png)
	
	> **Notes:**
	> - The user with single subscription won't be prompted to select subscription.
	> - The subscription highlighted in yellow will be selected by default if you do not enter any disired subscription. Please select the subscription carefully, as it may break the execution further.
	> - While you are waiting for processes to get completed in the Azure Cloud Shell window, you'll be asked to enter the code three times. This is necessary for performing installation of various Azure Services and preloading content in the Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Pool tables.

20. You will now be prompted to **enter** the resource group name in the Azure Cloud Shell. Type the same resource group name that you created in [Task 1](#task-1-create-a-resource-group-in-azure). – 'DDiB-Retail-Lab'.

	![Enter Resource Group name.](media/cloud-shell-14.png)

	> **Note:**
	> Note: You may see errors in script execution if you  do not have necessary permissions for cloudshell to manipulate your Power BI workspace. In such case follow this document [Power BI Embedding](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/blob/retail/retaildemo/Power%20BI%20Embedding.md) to get the necessary permissions assigned. You’ll have to manually upload the reports to your Power BI workspace by downloading them from this location [Reports](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement/tree/retail/retaildemo/artifacts/reports). Or you can execute the PowerBI Subscript from local PowerShell.

	![Paste the code.](media/cloud-shell-17.png)

	> Note: Make sure to provide the device code before it expires and let the script run till completion.

24. **Select** the same user to authenticate which you used for signing into the Azure Portal in [Task 1](#task-1-create-a-resource-group-in-azure). 

	![Select the same user.](media/cloud-shell-18.png)

25. **Close** the browser tab once you see the message window at right and go back to your Azure Cloud Shell execution window.

	![Close the browser.](media/cloud-shell-19.png)

	> **Note:** The deployment will take approximately 50-55 minutes to complete. Keep checking the progress with messages printed in the console to avoid timeout.

26. After complete script has been executed, you get to see a messages "--Execution Complete--", above which there are 3 links available as show in the image below. **Click** on each of those links once and then after the page loads close the brower tabs.

	![Click on the link.](media/cloud-shell-20.png)
	
	> Note: Clicking these links will ensure that the data simulator applications gets start and will not dislplay ani UI on browser page, instead may give error like 404, which is its expected behaviour.
