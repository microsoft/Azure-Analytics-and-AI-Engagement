# Setting the scene

## What is it?
DREAM Demos in a Box (DDiB) are packaged Industry Scenario DREAM Demos with ARM templates (with a demo web app, Power BI reports, Synapse resources, AML Notebooks etc.) that can be deployed in a customer’s subscription using the CAPE tool in a few hours.  Partners can also deploy DREAM Demos in their own subscriptions using DDiB.

 ## Objective & Intent
Partners can deploy DREAM Demos in their own Azure subscriptions and show live demos to customers. 
In partnership with Microsoft sellers, partners can deploy the Industry scenario DREAM demos into customer subscriptions. 
Customers can play,  get hands-on experience navigating through the demo environment in their own subscription and show to their own stakeholders
